NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

The standard Jakarta Persistence persistence strategy is to persist an object of a class into its own table. 
In some situations you may wish to map the class to a primary table as well as one or more secondary tables. 
For example when you have a Java class that could have been split up into 2 separate classes yet, for whatever reason, 
has been written as a single class, however you have a legacy datastore and you need to map objects of this class into 2 tables. 
Jakarta Persistence allows persistence of fields of a class into _secondary_ tables.

NOTE: A Secondary table entry maps 1-1 to an owner table entry, and has the same primary key as the owner.


The process for managing this situation is best demonstrated with an example. 
Let's suppose we have a class that represents a *Printer*. The *Printer* class contains within it various attributes of the toner cartridge. So we have

[source,java]
-----
package mydomain.secondarytable;

public class Printer
{
    long id;
    String make;
    String model;

    String tonerModel;
    int tonerLifetime;

    ....
}
-----

Now we have a database schema that has 2 tables (`PRINTER` and `PRINTER_TONER`) in which to store objects of this class.
So we need to tell DataNucleus to perform this mapping. So we define the MetaData for the *Printer* class like this

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@Table(name="PRINTER")
@SecondaryTable(name="PRINTER_TONER", pkJoinColumns=@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="PRINTER_REFID"))
public class Printer
{
    ...

    @Column(name="MODEL", table="PRINTER_TONER")
    String tonerModel;

    @Column(name="LIFETIME", table="PRINTER_TONER")
    int tonerLifetime;
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Printer">
    <table name="PRINTER"/>
    <secondary-table name="PRINTER_TONER">
        <primary-key-join-column name="PRINTER_REFID"/>
    </secondary-table>

    <attributes>
        ...
        <basic name="tonerModel">
            <column name="MODEL" table="PRINTER_TONER"/>
        </basic>
        <basic name="tonerLifetime">
            <column name="LIFETIME" table="PRINTER_TONER"/>
        </basic>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

Here we have defined that objects of the *Printer* class will be stored in the primary table `PRINTER`. 
In addition we have defined that some fields are stored in the table `PRINTER_TONER`.

* We declare the "secondary-table"(s) that we will be using at the start of the definition.
* We define _tonerModel_ and _tonerLifetime_ to use columns in the table `PRINTER_TONER`. This uses the "table" attribute of <column>
* Whilst defining the secondary table(s) we will be using, we also define the join column to be called `PRINTER_REFID`.

This results in the following database tables :-

image:../images/secondarytables_db.png[]

So we now have our primary and secondary database tables. The primary key of the `PRINTER_TONER` table serves as a foreign key to the primary class. 
Whenever we persist a *Printer* object a row will be inserted into *both* of these tables.
