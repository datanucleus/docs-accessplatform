Jakarta Persistence doesn't define support for persisting fields of type interface, but DataNucleus provides an extension whereby the implementations of the interface are entities. 
It follows the same general process as for link:mapping.html#objects[java.lang.Object] since both interfaces and java.lang.Object are basically _references_ to some entity.

To demonstrate interface handling let's introduce some classes. Suppose you have an interface with a selection of classes implementing the interface something like this

[source,java]
-----
public interface Shape
{
    double getArea();
}

public class Circle implements Shape
{
    double radius;
    ...
}

public class Square implements Shape
{
    double length;
    ...
}

public Rectange implements Shape
{
    double width;
    double length;
    ...
}
-----

You then have a class that contains an object of this interface type

[source,java]
-----
public class ShapeHolder
{
    protected Shape shape=null;
    ...
}
-----


With non-RDBMS datastores there is a single column holding the interface field value. With RDBMS you have the option of storing this interface field value in several different ways, as below.

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS.

DataNucleus allows the following strategies for mapping this field

* *per-implementation* : a FK is created for each implementation so that the datastore can provide referential integrity. 
The other advantage is that since there are FKs then querying can be performed. The disadvantage is that if there are many
implementations then the table can become large with many columns not used
* *identity* : a single column is added and this stores the class name of the implementation stored, as well as the identity of the object. 
The advantage is that if you have large numbers of implementations then this can cope with no schema change.
The disadvantages are that no querying can be performed, and that there is no referential integrity.
* *xcalia* : a slight variation on "identity" whereby there is a single column yet the contents of that column are consistent with 
what Xcalia XIC JDO implementation stored there.

The user controls which one of these is to be used by specifying the _extension_ *mapping-strategy* on the field containing the interface. 
The default is "per-implementation"

In terms of the implementations of the interface, you can either leave the field to accept any _known about_ implementation, 
or you can restrict it to only accept some implementations (see "implementation-classes" metadata extension).
If you are leaving it to accept any persistable implementation class, then you need to be careful that such implementations are known to 
DataNucleus at the point of encountering the interface field. By this we mean, DataNucleus has to have encountered the metadata for the implementation
so that it can allow for the implementation when handling the field. 
You can force DataNucleus to know about a persistable class by using `persistence.xml` to specify the classes.


[[interface_one_one]]
== 1-1 Interface Relation

To allow persistence of this interface field with DataNucleus you have 2 levels of control. The first level is global control. 
Since all of our _Square_, _Circle_, _Rectangle_ classes implement _Shape_ then we just define them in the MetaData as we would normally.

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Square implement Shape
{
    ...
}
@Entity
public class Circle implement Shape
{
    ...
}
@Entity
public class Rectangle implement Shape
{
    ...
}
-----

The global way means that when mapping that field DataNucleus will look at all Entities it knows about that implement the specified interface.

DataNucleus also allows users to specify a list of classes implementing the interface on a field-by-field basis, defining which of these implementations are accepted for a particular 
interface field. To do this you define the Meta-Data like this

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class ShapeHolder
{
    @OneToOne
    @Extension(key="implementation-classes",
        value="mydomain.Circle,mydomain.Rectangle,mydomain.Square")
    Shape shape;

    ...
}
-----

That is, for any interface object in a class to be persisted, you define the possible implementation classes that can be stored there. 
DataNucleus interprets this information and will map the above example classes to the following in the database

image:../images/interfaces_db.png[]

So DataNucleus adds foreign keys from the containers table to all of the possible implementation tables for the _shape_ field.

If we use *mapping-strategy* of "identity" then we get a different datastore schema.

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class ShapeHolder
{
    @OneToOne
    @Extension(key="implementation-classes", value="mydomain.Circle,mydomain.Rectangle,mydomain.Square")
    @Extension(key="mapping-strategy", value="identity")
    Shape shape;

    ...
}
-----

and the datastore schema becomes

image:../images/interfaces_identity_1_1_db.png[]

and the column "SHAPE" will contain strings such as _mydomain.Circle:1_ allowing retrieval of the related implementation object.


[[interface_one_many]]
== 1-N Interface Relation

You can have a Collection/Map containing elements of an interface type. 
You specify this in the same way as you would any Collection/Map. 
*You can have a Collection of interfaces as long as you use a join table relation and it is unidirectional.*
The "unidirectional" restriction is that the interface is not persistent on its own and so cannot store the reference back to the owner object.
Use the 1-N relationship guides for the metadata definition to use.

You need to use a DataNucleus extension *implementation-classes* if you want to restrict the collection to only contain particular implementations of an interface.
For example

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class ShapeHolder
{
    @OneToMany
    @JoinTable
    @Extension(key="implementation-classes", value="mydomain.Circle,mydomain.Rectangle,mydomain.Square")
    @Extension(key="mapping-strategy", value="identity")
    Collection<Shape> shapes;

    ...
}
-----

So the _shapes_ field is a Collection of _mydomain.Shape_ and it will accept the implementations of type *Circle*, *Rectangle*, *Square* and *Triangle*.
If you omit the *implementation-classes* extension then you have to give DataNucleus a way of finding the metadata for the implementations prior to encountering this field.


== Dynamic Schema Updates (RDBMS)

The default mapping strategy for interface fields and collections of interfaces is to have separate FK column(s) for each possible implementation of the interface.
Obviously if you have an application where new implementations are added over time the schema will need new FK column(s) adding to match. 
This is possible if you enable the persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.dynamicSchemaUpdates*, setting it to _true_. 
With this set, any insert/update operation of an interface related field will do a check if the implementation being stored is known about in the schema and,
if not, will update the schema accordingly.
