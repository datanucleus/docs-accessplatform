[[value_generation]]
= Value Generation
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/

Fields of a class can either have the values set by you the user, or you can set DataNucleus to 
generate them for you. This is of particular importance with identity fields where you want unique
identities. You can use this value generation process with the identity field(s) in Jakarta Persistence. 
There are many different "strategies" for generating values, as defined by the Jakarta Persistence specification.
Some strategies are specific to a particular datastore, and some are generic. You should
choose the strategy that best suits your target datastore. The available strategies are :-

* link:#valuegen_native[AUTO] - this is the default and allows DataNucleus to choose the most suitable for the datastore
* link:#valuegen_sequence[SEQUENCE] - this uses a datastore sequence (if supported by the datastore)
* link:#valuegen_identity[IDENTITY] - these use autoincrement/identity/serial features in the datastore (if supported by the datastore)
* link:#valuegen_increment[TABLE] - this is datastore neutral and increments a sequence value using a table.
* link:#valuegen_uuid[UUID] - datastore neutral, created in the JRE. Provided by DataNucleus
* link:#valuegen_custom[Custom generators] - these are beyond the scope of the Jakarta Persistence spec but provided by DataNucleus

See also:-

* link:metadata_xml.html#generated-value[Jakarta MetaData reference for <generated-value>]
* link:annotations.html#GeneratedValue[Jakarta Annotation reference for @GeneratedValue]

NOTE: the Jakarta Persistence spec only requires the ability to generate values for identity fields. DataNucleus allows you to do it for any field. 
Please bear this in mind when considering portability

NOTE: By defining a value-strategy for a field then it will, by default, always generate a value for that field on persist. 
If the field can store nulls and you only want it to generate the value at persist when it is null (i.e you haven't assigned a value yourself) 
then you can add the extension _"strategy-when-notnull"_ as _false_


[[valuegen_native]]
== ValueGeneration Strategy AUTO

With this strategy DataNucleus will choose the most appropriate strategy for the datastore being used.
If you define the field as String-based then it will choose link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_uuidhex[uuid-hex]. 
Otherwise the field is numeric in which case it chooses link:#valuegen_identity[identity] if supported, 
otherwise link:#valuegen_sequence[sequence] if supported, otherwise link:#valuegen_increment[table] if supported
otherwise throws an exception.


On RDBMS you can get the behaviour used up until DN v3.0 by specifying the persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.useLegacyNativeValueStrategy* as _true_.

For a class using *application identity* you need to set the _value-strategy_ attribute on the primary key field. 
You can configure the Meta-Data for the class something like this 

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <id name="myId">
            <generated-value strategy="AUTO"/>
        </id>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    private long myId;
    ...
}
-----

To configure a class to use this generation using *datastore identity* you need to look at the `@DatastoreId` extension annotation or the XML `<datastore-id>` tag


WARNING: Which generation strategy is used internally will be Jakarta provider dependent. 
If you want to be portable and independent of a Jakarta providers internals you should likely avoid use of `AUTO`.



[[valuegen_sequence]]
== ValueGeneration Strategy SEQUENCE

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS (Oracle, PostgreSQL, SAPDB, DB2, Firebird, HSQLDB, H2, Derby, SQLServer, NuoDB).

A sequence is a user-defined database function that generates a sequence of unique numeric ids. 
The unique identifier value returned from the database is translated to a java type: java.lang.Long
To configure a class to use this strategy using *application identity* you would add the following to the class' Meta-Data

[source,xml]
-----
<sequence-generator name="SEQ1" sequence-name="MY_SEQ" initial-value="5" allocation-size="10"/>
<entity class="MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <id name="myId">
            <generated-value strategy="SEQUENCE" generator="SEQ1"/>
        </id>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@SequenceGenerator(name="SEQ1", sequenceName="MY_SEQ", initialValue=5, allocationSize=10)
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator="SEQ1")
    private long myId;
    ...
}
-----

If the sequence does not yet exist in the database at the time DataNucleus needs a new unique identifier, a new sequence is created in the database 
based on the Jakarta Meta-Data configuration. 

Extension properties for configuring sequences can be set in the Jakarta Meta-Data (via `@Extension` or `<extension>`), see the available properties below. 
Unsupported properties by a database are silently ignored by DataNucleus.

To configure a class to use this generation using *datastore identity* you need to look at the `@DatastoreId` extension annotation or the XML `<datastore-id>` tag.

This value generator will generate values unique across different JVMs

Values generated using this generator are available in `@PrePersist`.

[[valuegen_identity]]
== ValueGeneration Strategy IDENTITY

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS (IDENTITY (DB2, SQLServer, Sybase, HSQLDB, H2, Derby, NuoDB), AUTOINCREMENT (MySQL, MariaDB) SERIAL (PostgreSQL)), MongoDB (String), Neo4j (long)


Auto-increment/identity/serial are primary key columns that are populated when a row is inserted in the table. 
These use the databases own keywords on table creation and so rely on having the table structure either created by DataNucleus or having the column with the necessary keyword.
Any field using this strategy will NOT be present in any INSERT statement, and will be set in the datastore as a result.

TIP: This generation strategy should only be used if there is a single "root" table for the inheritance tree. If you have more than 1 root table (e.g using subclass-table inheritance)
then you should choose a different generation strategy

For a class using *application identity* you need to set the _value-strategy_ attribute on the primary key field. You can configure the Meta-Data for the class something like this 

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <id name="myId">
            <generated-value strategy="IDENTITY"/>
        </id>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long myId;
    ...
}
-----

Please be aware that if you have an inheritance tree with the base class defined as using "identity" then the column definition for the PK 
of the base table will be defined as "AUTO_INCREMENT" or "IDENTITY" or "SERIAL" (dependent on the RDBMS) and all subtables will NOT have 
this identifier added to their PK column definitions. This is because the identities are assigned in the base table (since all objects will have 
an entry in the base table).

*Please note that if using optimistic transactions, this strategy will mean that the value is only set when the object is actually persisted (i.e at flush() or commit())*

To configure a class to use this generation using *datastore identity* you need to look at the `@DatastoreId` extension annotation or the XML `<datastore-id>` tag

This value generator will generate values unique across different JVMs.

Values generated using this generator are NOT available in `@PrePersist`, being generated at persist only.


[[valuegen_increment]]
== ValueGeneration Strategy TABLE

NOTE: Applies to RDBMS, ODF, Excel, OOXML, HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4j.

This method is database neutral and uses a sequence table that holds an incrementing sequence value. The unique identifier value returned from the 
database is translated to a java type: java.lang.Long. This method require a sequence table in the database and creates one if doesn't exist.

To configure an *application identity* class to use this generation method you simply add this to the class' Meta-Data. If your class is in an inheritance 
tree you should define this for the base class only.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="MyClass">
    <table-generator name="myGenerator" table="TABLE_VALUE_GEN" pkColumnName="GEN_KEY" valueColumnName="GEN_VALUE" pkColumnValue="MyClass"/>
    <attributes>
        <id name="myId">
            <generated-value strategy="TABLE"/>
        </id>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@TableGenerator(name="myGenerator", table="TABLE_VALUE_GEN", pkColumnName="GEN_KEY", valueColumnName="GEN_VALUE", pkColumnValue="MyClass")
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.TABLE, generator="myGenerator")
    private long myId;
    ...
}
-----

This will create a table in the datastore called `TABLE_VALUE_GEN` with columns `GEN_KEY`, `GEN_VALUE` with the key for the row for this class being "MyClass".



Extension properties for configuring sequences can be set in the Jakarta Meta-Data (via `@Extension` or `<extension>`), see the available properties below.

|sequence-table-basis
|Whether to define uniqueness on the base class name or the base table name.

|No. Defaults to _class_, but the other option is _table_

|table-name
|Name of the table whose column we are generating the value for (used when we have no previous sequence value and want a start point).
|No.

|column-name

[[valuegen_uuid]]
== ValueGeneration Strategy "UUID"

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Applicable to all datastores.

This generator uses the JRE UUID class to generate String values. The values are 128-bit (36 character) of the form _0e400c2c-b3a0-4786-a0c6-f2607bf643eb_.

This generator can be used in concurrent applications. It is especially useful in situations where large numbers of transactions within a certain amount of time have to be made, and the 
additional overhead of synchronizing the concurrent creation of unique identifiers through the database would break performance limits.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <id name="myId">
            <generated-value strategy="UUID"/>
        </id>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
public class MyClass
{
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.UUID)
    String myId;
}
-----

This value generator will generate values unique across different JVMs.

NOTE: To use this strategy via annotations you need to have the DataNucleus `jakarta.persistence.jar` present in the CLASSPATH.


[[valuegen_custom]]
== ValueGeneration Strategy "Custom"

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

Jakarta Persistence only provides a very restricted set of value generators. DataNucleus provides various others internally. 
To access these you need to use a custom strategy as follows

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <id name="myId">
            <generated-value strategy="uuid"/>
        </id>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jakarta.annotations.ValueGenerator;

@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    @ValueGenerator(strategy="uuid")
    private String myId;
    ...
}
-----

This will generate java UUID Strings in the "myId" field. You can also set the "strategy" to 
link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_auid["auid"], 
link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_uuidstring["uuid-string"], link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_uuid_hex["uuid-hex"], 
link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_uuid["uuid"], link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_uuid_object["uuid-object"] 
link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_timestamp["timestamp"] and link:../jdo/mapping.html#valuegen_timestamp_value["timestamp_value"].

Values generated using these generators are available in `@PrePersist`.
