= Native Queries

The Jakarta Persistence specification defines its interpretation of native queries, for selecting objects from the datastore. 
To provide a simple example for RDBMS (i.e using SQL), this is what you would do

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT p.id, o.firstName, o.lastName FROM Person p, Job j WHERE (p.job = j.id) AND j.name = 'Cleaner'");
List results = (List)q.getResultsList();
-----

This finds all "Person" objects that do the job of "Cleaner". The syntax chosen has to be runnable on the RDBMS
that you are using (and since SQL is anything but "standard" you will likely have to change your query when moving to another datastore).


[[native_parameters]]
== Input Parameters

In queries it is convenient to pass in parameters so we don't have to define the same query for different values. Here's an example

[source,java]
-----
// Numbered Parameters :
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p.id FROM Person p WHERE p.lastName = ?1 AND p.firstName = ?2");
q.setParameter(1, theSurname).setParameter(2, theForename);
-----

So we have parameters that are prefixed by *?* (question mark) and are numbered starting at 1.
We then use the numbered position when calling _Query.setParameter()_. This is known as _numbered_ parameters.
With Jakarta native queries we can't use named parameters officially.

DataNucleus also actually supports use of _named_ parameters where you assign names just like in JPQL.
This is not defined by the Jakarta Persistence specification so dont expect other Jakarta implementations to support it.
Let's take the previous example and rewrite it using _named_ parameters, like this

[source,java]
-----
// Named Parameters :
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p.id FROM Person p WHERE p.lastName = :firstParam AND p.firstName = :otherParam");
q.setParameter("firstParam", theSurname).setParameter("otherParam", theForename);
-----


== Range of Results

With SQL you can select the range of results to be returned. For example if you have a web page and you are paginating the results of some search, 
you may want to get the results from a query in blocks of 20 say, with results 0 to 19 on the first page, then 20 to 39, etc. You can facilitate this as follows

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT p.id FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 20");
q.setFirstResult(0).setMaxResults(20);
-----

So with this query we get results 0 to 19 inclusive.


[[sql_syntax_checks]]
== SQL Syntax Checks

When a native query is a SELECT, and is returning instances of an Entity, then it is required to return the columns for the PK, version and discriminator (if applicable).
DataNucleus provides some checks that can be performed to ensure that these are selected. 
You can turn this checking off by setting the persistence property *datanucleus.query.sql.syntaxChecks* to _false_. 
Similarly you can turn them off on a query-by-query basis by setting the query hint *datanucleus.query.sql.syntaxChecks* to _false_.


== Query Execution

There are two ways to execute a native query. When you know it will return 0 or 1 results you call

[source,java]
-----
Object result = query.getSingleResult();
-----

If however you know that the query will return multiple results, or you just don't know then you would call

[source,java]
-----
List results = query.getResultList();
-----


== SQL Result Definition

By default, if you simply execute a native query and don't specify the result mapping, then when you execute _getResultList()_ each row of the results will be an Object array. 
You can however define how the results are mapped to some result class for example. Let's give some examples of what you can do. If we have the following entities

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@Table(name="LOGIN")
public class Login
{
    @Id
    private long id;

    private String userName;
    private String password;

    public Login(String user, String pwd)
    {
        ...
    }
}

@Entity
@Table(name="LOGINACCOUNT")
public class LoginAccount
{
    @Id
    private long id;

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    @OneToOne(cascade={CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.PERSIST}, orphanRemoval=true)
    @JoinColumn(name="LOGIN_ID")
    private Login login;

    public LoginAccount(long id, String firstName, String lastName)
    {
        ...
    }
}
-----

The first thing to do is to select both LOGIN and LOGINACCOUNT columns in a single call, and return instances of the 2 entities.
So we define the following in the _LoginAccount_ class

[source,java]
-----
@SqlResultSetMappings({
    @SqlResultSetMapping(name="LOGIN_PLUS_ACCOUNT", 
        entities={@EntityResult(entityClass=LoginAccount.class), @EntityResult(entityClass=Login.class)})
-----

and we now execute the native query as

[source,java]
-----
List<Object[]> result = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT P.ID, P.FIRSTNAME, P.LASTNAME, P.LOGIN_ID, L.ID, L.USERNAME, L.PASSWORD " +
    "FROM JKA_AN_LOGINACCOUNT P, JKA_AN_LOGIN L", "AN_LOGIN_PLUS_ACCOUNT").getResultList();
Iterator iter = result.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext())
{
    Object[] row = iter.next();
    LoginAccount acct = (LoginAccount)obj[0];
    Login login = (Login)obj[1];
    ...
}
-----

Next thing to try is the same as above, returning 2 entities for a row, but here we explicitly define the mapping of SQL column to the constructor parameter.

[source,java]
-----
@SqlResultSetMapping(name="AN_LOGIN_PLUS_ACCOUNT_ALIAS", entities={
            @EntityResult(entityClass=LoginAccount.class, fields={@FieldResult(name="id", column="THISID"), @FieldResult(name="firstName", column="FN")}),
            @EntityResult(entityClass=Login.class, fields={@FieldResult(name="id", column="IDLOGIN"), @FieldResult(name="userName", column="UN")})
        })
-----

and we now execute the native query as

[source,java]
-----
List<Object[]> result = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT P.ID AS THISID, P.FIRSTNAME AS FN, P.LASTNAME, P.LOGIN_ID, " +
    "L.ID AS IDLOGIN, L.USERNAME AS UN, L.PASSWORD FROM JKA_AN_LOGINACCOUNT P, JKA_AN_LOGIN L", "AN_LOGIN_PLUS_ACCOUNT_ALIAS").getResultList();
Iterator iter = result.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext())
{
    Object[] row = iter.next();
    LoginAccount acct = (LoginAccount)obj[0];
    Login login = (Login)obj[1];
    ...
}
-----

For our final example we will return each row as a non-entity class, defining how the columns map to the constructor for the result class.

[source,java]
-----
@SqlResultSetMapping(name="AN_LOGIN_PLUS_ACCOUNT_CONSTRUCTOR", classes={
           @ConstructorResult(targetClass=LoginAccountComplete.class,
               columns={@ColumnResult(name="FN"), @ColumnResult(name="LN"), @ColumnResult(name="USER"), @ColumnResult(name="PWD")}),
        })
-----

with non-entity result class defined as

[source,java]
-----
public class LoginAccountComplete
{
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
    String userName;
    String password;

    public LoginAccountComplete(String firstName, String lastName, String userName, String password)
    {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
-----

and we execute the query like this

[source,java]
-----
List result = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT P.FIRSTNAME AS FN, P.LASTNAME AS LN, L.USERNAME AS USER, L.PASSWORD AS PWD FROM " +
    "JKA_AN_LOGINACCOUNT P, JKA_AN_LOGIN L","AN_LOGIN_PLUS_ACCOUNT_CONSTRUCTOR").getResultList();
Iterator iter = result.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext())
{
    LoginAccountComplete acctCmp = (LoginAccountComplete)iter.next();
    ...
}
-----


[[native_named]]
== Named Native Query

With the Jakarta Persistence API you can either define a query at runtime, or define it in the MetaData/annotations for a class and refer to it at runtime using a symbolic name. 
This second option means that the method of invoking the query at runtime is much simplified. To demonstrate the process, lets say we have a class called _Product_ 
(something to sell in a store). We define the Jakarta Meta-Data for the class in the normal way, but we also have some query that we know we will require, so we 
define the following in the Meta-Data.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Product">
    ...
    <named-native-query name="PriceBelowValue"><![CDATA[
    SELECT NAME FROM PRODUCT WHERE PRICE < ?1
    ]]></named-native-query>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@NamedNativeQuery(name="PriceBelowValue", query="SELECT NAME FROM PRODUCT WHERE PRICE < ?1")
public class Product {...}
-----

So here we have a native query that will return the names of all Products that have a price less than a specified value. 
This leaves us the flexibility to specify the value at runtime. So here we run our named native query, asking for the names of all Products with price below 20 euros.

[source,java]
-----
Query query = em.createNamedQuery("PriceBelowValue");
List results = query.setParameter(1, new Double(20.0)).getResultList();
-----


[[cassandra_native]]
== Cassandra Native (CQL) Queries

NOTE: If you choose to use Cassandra CQL Queries then these are not portable to any other datastore. Use JPQL for portability

Cassandra provides the CQL query language. To take a simple example using it with the Jakarta Persistence API and a Cassandra datastore

[source,java]
-----
// Find all employees
Query q = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT * FROM schema1.Employee", Employee.class);
List<Employee> results = (List)q.getResultList();
-----

Note that the last argument to _createNativeQuery_ is optional and you would get _List<Object[]>_ returned otherwise.
