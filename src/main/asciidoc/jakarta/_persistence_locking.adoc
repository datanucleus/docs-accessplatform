Within a transaction it is very common to require some form of locking of objects so that you can guarantee the integrity of data that is committed.
There are the following locking types for a transaction.

* Assume that things in the datastore will not change until they are ready to commit, not lock any records and 
then just before committing make a check for changes. This is known as link:#locking_optimistic[Optimistic Locking].
* Lock specific records in a datastore and keep them locked until commit of the changes. 
These are known as link:#locking_pessimistic[Pessimistic (or datastore) Locking].


[[locking_optimistic]]
== Optimistic Locking

Optimistic "locking" is suitable for longer lived operations maybe where user interaction is taking place and where it would be undesirable to block access to 
datastore entities for the duration of the transaction. The assumption is that data altered in this transaction will not be updated by 
other transactions during the duration of this transaction, so the changes are not propagated to the datastore until commit()/flush(). 
The obvious benefit of optimistic locking is that all changes are made in a block and version checking of objects is performed before application of changes, 
hence this mode copes better with external processes updating the objects.

The (version of) data is checked when data is flushed (typically at commit) to ensure the integrity in this respect. 
The most convenient way of checking data for updates is to maintain a column on each table that handles optimistic locking data to store a version. 

Rather than placing version columns on all user datastore tables, Jakarta allows the user to notate particular classes as requiring _optimistic_ treatment. 
This is performed by specifying in MetaData (XML or annotations) the details of the field/column to use for storing the version - see link:mapping.html#versioning[versioning]. 
With strict Jakarta Persistence you must have a field in your class ready to store the version. With DataNucleus we also allow a version to be stored in a surrogate column
hence not requiring a field in the actual class.



In terms of the process of optimistic locking, we demonstrate this below.

We have our flush mode set to not commit until flush/commit is called (FlushModeType.AUTO). 
When flush is performed (either manually, via commit, or via a query requiring it) the version check(s) are performed for any modified objects to be flushed, as long as
they have a version defined. Please note that for some datastores (e.g RDBMS) the version check followed by update/delete is performed in a single statement.

[[locking_pessimistic]]
== Pessimistic (Datastore) Locking

*Pessimistic* locking isn't the default behaviour with Jakarta but can be configured.
It is suitable for short lived operations where no user interaction is taking place and so it is possible to block access to datastore entities for the duration of the transaction.
Such locking is best employed on specific objects, rather as a global process applying to all retrieved objects.

To disable optimistic locking (or version checking) globally you would add the persistence property *datanucleus.Optimistic* as _false_. 
Additionally, for RDBMS, to pessimistically lock ALL retrieved objects you would also set the persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.useUpdateLock* to _true_. 

Any object that has a pessimistic lock will result in (for RDBMS) all "SELECT ... FROM ..." retrieval statements being changed to be "SELECT ... FROM ... FOR UPDATE"; 
this will be applied only where the underlying RDBMS supports the "FOR UPDATE" syntax.

With pessimistic locking DataNucleus will grab a datastore connection at the first operation, and maintain it for the duration of the transaction. 
A single connection is used for the transaction (with the exception of any link:mapping.html#value_generation[Value Generation] operations which need datastore 
access, so these can use their own connection).


The Jakarta EntityManager allows control over locking on an object-by-object basis with several methods. For example

[source,java]
-----
Person person = em.find(Person.class, 1, LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ);
-----
will retrieve the _Person_ object with identity 1, and will lock it until the end of the transaction.


You can additionally perform an explicit lock on a specific object like this

[source,java]
-----
em.lock(person, LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ);
-----
which will lock the object from that point in the transaction.

If you wanted to lock all objects affected by a query, you can set the lock mode of the query, like this

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.lastName = 'Smith'");
q.setLockMode(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ);
List<Person> results = q.getResultList();
-----
which will add a pessimistic lock on all _Person_ objects with surname _Smith_.



In terms of the process of pessimistic (datastore) locking, we demonstrate this below.
Here we have disabled the default "optimistic" check process (using *datanucleus.Optimistic* being set to _false_).

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
|Operation
|DataNucleus process
|Datastore process

|Start transaction
|
|

|Persist object
|Prepare object (1) for persistence
|*Open connection.*
Insert the object (1) into the datastore

|Update object
|Prepare object (2) for update
|Update the object (2) into the datastore

|Persist object
|Prepare object (3) for persistence
|Insert the object (3) into the datastore

|Update object
|Prepare object (4) for update
|Update the object (4) into the datastore

|Flush
|No outstanding changes so do nothing
|

|Perform query
|Generate query in datastore language
|Query the datastore and return selected objects

|Persist object
|Prepare object (5) for persistence
|Insert the object (5) into the datastore

|Update object
|Prepare object (6) for update
|Update the object (6) into the datastore

|Commit transaction
|
|*Commit connection*
|===

So here (due to the flush mode chosen, and due to the default optimistic locking being disabled), whenever an operation is performed, DataNucleus pushes it straight to the datastore.
Consequently any queries will always reflect the current state of all objects in use.
This mode of operation has no version checking of objects and so, if they were updated by external processes in the meantime then, they will overwrite those changes. 
This is where the locking statements for particular objects is crucial, preventing them being updated externally.


One further thing to note is that you can have optimistic locking, whilst also having pessimistic locking of specific objects. You achieve this by following the optimistic locking
process above, but using _find_ and _createQuery_ to lock specific objects using an appropriate pessimistic `LockModeType`.


It should be noted that DataNucleus provides two persistence properties that allow an amount of control over when flushing happens with pessimistic locking

* _datanucleus.flush.mode_ when set to MANUAL will try to delay all datastore operations until commit/flush.
* _datanucleus.datastoreTransactionFlushLimit_ represents the number of dirty objects before a flush is performed. This defaults to 1.
