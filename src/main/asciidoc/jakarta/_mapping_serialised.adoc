Jakarta Persistence provides a way for users to specify that a field will be persisted _serialised_. This is of use, for example, to collections/maps/arrays which typically 
are stored using join tables or foreign-keys to other records. By specifying that a field is serialised a column will be added to store that field and the 
field will be serialised into it.

Jakarta Persistence's definition of serialising applies to any field and all in the same way, unlike the situation with JDO which provides much more flexibility. 
Perhaps the most important thing to bear in mind when deciding to serialise a field is that that object in the field being serialised must implement 
_java.io.Serializable_.


[[serialise_field]]
== Serialised Fields

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, HBase, MongoDB

If you wish to serialise a particular field into a single column (in the table of the class), you need to simply mark the field as a "lob" (large object). 
Let's take an example. We have the following classes

[source,java]
-----
public class Farm
{
    Collection<Animal> animals;

    ...
}

public class Animal
{
    ...
}
-----

and we want the _animals_ collection to be serialised into a single column in the table storing the *Farm* class, so we define our MetaData like this

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Farm
{
    @Lob
    Collection<Animal> animals;

    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Farm">
    <table name="FARM"/>
    <attributes>
        ...
        <basic name="animals">
            <column name="ANIMALS"/>
            <lob/>
        </basic>
        ...
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

So we make use of the `<lob>` element / `@Lob` annotation. This specification results in a table like this

image:../images/serialised_collection_db.png[]

WARNING: Queries cannot be performed on collections stored as serialised.

NOTE: If the field that we want to serialise is of type String, byte array, char array, Byte array or Character array then the field will be serialised into a CLOB column rather than BLOB.

[[serialise_to_file]]
== Serialise to File

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

*Note this is not part of the Jakarta Persistence spec, but is available in DataNucleus to ease your usage.*
If you have a non-relation field that implements Serializable you have the option of serialising it into a file on the local disk. 
This could be useful where you have a large file and don't want to persist very large objects into your RDBMS. 
Obviously this will mean that the field is no longer queryable, but then if its a large file you likely don't care about that. 
So let's give an example

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Person
{
    @Id
    long id;

    @Basic
    @Lob
    @Extension(vendorName="datanucleus", key="serializeToFileLocation", value="person_avatars")
    AvatarImage image;
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Person">
    <attributes>
        ...
        <basic name="image">
            <lob/>
            <extension key="serializeToFileLocation" value="person_avatars"
        </basic>
        ...
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

So this will now persist a file into a folder `person_avatars` with filename as the String form of the identity of the owning object. 
In a real world example you likely will specify the extension value as an absolute path name, so you can place it anywhere in the local disk.
