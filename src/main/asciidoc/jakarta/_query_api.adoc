Let's now try to understand the Query API in Jakarta.
image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/jakarta.persistence/3.0/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/Query.html].
We firstly need to look at a typical Query. We'll take 2 examples

Let's create a JPQL query to highlight its usage

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.param2 < :threshold ORDER BY p.param1 ASC");
q.setParameter("threshold", my_threshold);
List results = q.getResultList();
-----

In this Query, we implicitly select JPQL by using the method _EntityManager.createQuery()_, and the query is specified 
to return all objects of type _Product_ (or subclasses) which have the field _param2_ less than some threshold 
value ordering the results by the value of field _param1_. We've specified the query like this because we want to pass 
the threshold value in as a parameter (so maybe running it once with one value, and once with a different value).
We then set the parameter value of our _threshold_ parameter. The Query is then executed to return a List of results. 
The example is to highlight the typical methods specified for a (JPQL) Query.


And for a second example we create a native (SQL) query

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT * FROM Product p WHERE p.param2 < ?1");
q.setParameter(1, my_threshold);
List results = q.getResultList();
-----

So we implicitly select SQL by using the method _EntityManager.createNativeQuery()_, and the query is specified like in the JPQL case 
to return all instances of type _Product_ (using the table name in this SQL query) where the column _param2_ is less than some threshold value.



[[query_range]]
== setFirstResult(), setMaxResults()

A query will by default return all of the results that it finds. You can restrict how many results are returned by use of two methods. So you could do

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.param2 < :threshold ORDER BY p.param1 ASC");
q.setFirstResult(1);
q.setMaxResults(3);
-----

so we will get results 1, 2, and 3 returned only. The first result starts at 0 by default.


[[query_hints]]
== setHint()

Jakarta's query API allows implementations to support extensions ("hints") and provides a simple interface for enabling the use of such extensions on queries.

[source,java]
-----
q.setHint("{extension_name}", value);
-----

Jakarta Persistence supports some standard hints, namely *jakarta.persistence.fetchgraph*, *jakarta.persistence.loadgraph*, *jakarta.persistence.query.timeout*,
*jakarta.persistence.lock.timeout*.
DataNucleus provides various vendor-specific hints for different types of queries (see different parts of this documentation).


[[query_parameters]]
== setParameter()

When queries take values (literals) it is usually best practice to define these as parameters.
Jakarta's query API supports named and numbered parameters and provides method for setting the value of particular parameters. 
To set a named parameter, for example, you could do

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.param2 < :threshold ORDER BY p.param1 ASC");
q.setParameter("threshold", value);
-----

To set a numbered parameter you could do

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.param2 < ?1 ORDER BY p.param1 ASC");
q.setParameter(1, value);
-----

Numbered parameters are numbered from 1.



[[query_executelist]]
== getResultList()

To execute a Jakarta query you would typically call _getResultList_. This will return a List of results. 
This should not be called when the query is an "UPDATE"/"DELETE".

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.param2 < :threshold ORDER BY p.param1 ASC");
q.setParameter("threshold", value);
List results = q.getResultList();
-----


[[query_executesingle]]
== getSingleResult()

To execute a Jakarta query where you are expecting a single value to be returned you would call _getSingleResult_. This will return the single Object. 
If the query returns more than one result then you will get a _NonUniqueResultException_.
This should not be called when the query is an "UPDATE"/"DELETE".

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.param2 = :value");
q.setParameter("value", val1);
Product prod = q.getSingleResult();
-----


[[query_executeupdate]]
== executeUpdate()

To execute a Jakarta UPDATE/DELETE query you would call _executeUpdate_. 
This will return the number of objects changed by the call.
This should not be called when the query is a "SELECT".

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("DELETE FROM Product p");
int number = q.executeUpdate();
-----


[[query_flushmode]]
== setFlushMode()

By default, when a query is executed it will be evaluated against the contents of the datastore at the point of execution. 
If there are any outstanding changes waiting to be flushed then these will not feature in the results. 
To make sure all outstanding changes are respected

[source,java]
-----
q.setFlushMode(FlushModeType.AUTO);
-----


[[query_lockmode]]
== setLockMode()

Jakarta Persistence allows control over whether objects found by a fetch (JPQL query) are locked during that
transaction so that other transactions can't update them in the meantime. For example

[source,java]
-----
q.setLockMode(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ);
-----

You can also specify this for all queries for all EntityManagers using a persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.useUpdateLock*.


[[query_loadResultsAtCommit]]
== Large Result Sets : Loading Results at Commit()

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When a transaction is committed by default all remaining results for a query are loaded so that the query is usable thereafter. 
With a large result set you clearly don't want this to happen. So in this case you should set the query hint *datanucleus.query.loadResultsAtCommit* to _false_, like this

[source,java]
-----
query.setHint("datanucleus.query.loadResultsAtCommit", "false");
-----


[[query_resultCacheType]]
== Result Set : Caching of Results

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When you execute a query, the query results are typically loaded when the user accesses each row. Results that have been read can then be cached locally.
You can control this caching to optimise it for your memory requirements. 
You can set the query hint *datanucleus.query.resultCacheType* and it has the following possible values

* _weak_ : use a weak reference map for caching (default)
* _soft_ : use a soft reference map for caching
* _strong_ : use a Map for caching (objects not garbage collected)
* _none_ : no caching (hence uses least memory)

To do this on a per query basis, you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.setHint("datanucleus.query.resultCacheType", "weak");
-----


[[query_resultSizeMethod]]
== Large Result Sets : Size

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

If you have a large result set you clearly don't want to instantiate all objects since this would hit the memory footprint of your application. 
To get the number of results many JDBC drivers, for example, will load all rows of the result set. 
This is to be avoided so DataNucleus provides control over the mechanism for getting the size of results.
The persistence property *datanucleus.query.resultSizeMethod* has a default of _last_ (which means navigate to the last object, hence hitting the JDBC driver problem). 
On RDBMS, if you set this to _count_ then it will use a simple "count()" query to get the size.

To do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.setHint("datanucleus.query.resultSizeMethod", "count");
-----



[[query_resultset_type]]
== RDBMS : Result Set Type

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

For RDBMS datastores, _java.sql.ResultSet_ defines three possible result set types.

* _forward-only_ : the result set is navegable forwards only
* _scroll-sensitive_ : the result set is scrollable in both directions and is sensitive to changes in the datastore
* _scroll-insensitive_ : the result set is scrollable in both directions and is insensitive to changes in the datastore

DataNucleus allows specification of this type as a query extension *datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetType*.

To do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.setHint("datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetType", "scroll-insensitive");
-----

The default is _forward-only_. The benefit of the other two is that the result set will be scrollable and hence objects will only be read 
in to memory when accessed. So if you have a large result set you should set this to one of the scrollable values.



[[query_resultset_control]]
== RDBMS : Result Set Control
image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus RDBMS provides a useful extension allowing control over the ResultSet's that are created by queries. 
You have at your convenience some properties that give you the power to control whether the result set is read only, 
whether it can be read forward only, the direction of fetching etc. 

To do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.setHint("datanucleus.rdbms.query.fetchDirection", "forward");
query.setHint("datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetConcurrency", "read-only");
-----

Alternatively you can specify these as persistence properties so that they apply to all queries for that PMF/EMF. Again, the properties are

* *datanucleus.rdbms.query.fetchDirection* - controls the direction that the ResultSet is navigated. By default this is forwards only. Use this property to change that.
* *datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetConcurrency* - controls whether the ResultSet is read only or updateable.


Bear in mind that not all RDBMS support all of the possible values for these options. That said, they do add a degree of control that is often useful.
