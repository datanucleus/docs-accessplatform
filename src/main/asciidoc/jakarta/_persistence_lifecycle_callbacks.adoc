= Lifecycle Callbacks

Jakarta Persistence defines a mechanism whereby an Entity can be marked as a listener for lifecycle events. 
Alternatively a separate entity listener class can be defined to receive these events. 
Thereafter when entities of the particular class go through lifecycle changes events are passed to the provided methods. 
Let's look at the two different mechanisms


== Entity Callbacks

An Entity itself can have several methods defined to receive events when any instances of that
class pass through lifecycles changes. Let's take an example

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    @Id
    Long accountId;

    Integer balance;
    boolean preferred;

    public Integer getBalance() { ... }

    @PrePersist
    protected void validateCreate()
    {
        if (getBalance() < MIN_REQUIRED_BALANCE)
        {
            throw new AccountException("Insufficient balance to open an account");
        }
    }

    @PostLoad
    protected void adjustPreferredStatus()
    {
        preferred = (getBalance() >= AccountManager.getPreferredStatusLevel());
    }
}
-----

So in this example just before any "Account" object is persisted the _validateCreate_ method will be called. 
In the same way, just after the fields of any "Account" object are loaded the _adjustPreferredStatus_ method is called. 
Very simple.

You can register callbacks for the following lifecycle events

* PrePersist
* PostPersist
* PreRemove
* PostRemove
* PreUpdate
* PostUpdate
* PostLoad

The only other rule is that any method marked to be a callback method has to take no arguments as input, and have void return.


== Entity Listener

As an alternative to having the actual callback methods in the Entity class itself you can define a separate class as an _EntityListener_. 
So lets take the example shown before and do it for an EntityListener.

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@EntityListeners(mydomain.MyEntityListener.class)
public class Account
{
    @Id
    Long accountId;

    Integer balance;
    boolean preferred;

    public Integer getBalance() { ... }
}
-----

[source,java]
-----
package mydomain;

public class MyEntityListener
{
    @PostPersist
    public void newAccountAlert(Account acct)
    {
         ... do something when we get a new Account
    }
}
-----

So we define our "Account" entity as normal but mark it with an _EntityListener_, and then in the _EntityListener_ we define the callbacks we require. 
As before we can define any of the 7 callbacks as we require. 
The only difference is that the callback method has to take an argument of type "Object" that it will be called for, and have void return.

NOTE: The Entity Listeners objects shown here are *stateless*.


NOTE: DataNucleus allows for stateful event listener objects, with the state being CDI injectable, but you must be in a CDI environment for this to work.
To provide CDI support for Jakarta, you should specify the persistence property *jakarta.persistence.bean.manager* to be a CDI `BeanManager` object.
