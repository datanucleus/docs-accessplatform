[[many_one_relations]]
= N-1 Relations
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/

You have a N-to-1 relationship when an object of a class has an associated object of another class (only one 
associated object) and several of this type of object can be linked to the same associated object. From the
other end of the relationship it is effectively a 1-N, but from the point of view of the object in question,
it is N-1. You can create the relationship in 2 ways depending on whether the 2 classes know about each other
(bidirectional), or whether only the "N" side knows about the other class (unidirectional). 
These are described below.

NOTE: For RDBMS a N-1 relation is stored as a foreign-key column(s). For non-RDBMS it is stored as a String "column" storing the 'id' (possibly with the class-name 
included in the string) of the related object.

NOTE: You cannot have an N-1 relation to a long or int field! Jakarta Persistence is for use with object-oriented systems, not flat data.


[[many_one_uni_fk]]
== Unidirectional (ForeignKey)

For this case you could have 2 classes, *User* and *Account*, as below.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

so the *Account* class ("N" side) knows about the *User* class ("1" side), but not vice-versa. A particular user could be related to several accounts. 
If you define the annotations for these classes as follows

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    ...

    @ManyToOne
    User user;
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity-mappings>
    <entity class="User">
        <table name="USER"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="USER_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
        </attributes>
    </entity>

    <entity class="Account">
        <table name="ACCOUNT"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="ACCOUNT_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
            <many-to-one name="user"/>
        </attributes>
    </entity>
</entity-mappings>
-----

This will create 2 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), and `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*), 
and a foreign-key in the `ACCOUNT` table, just like for the case of a link:mapping.html#one_one_uni[One-to-One relation].

NOTE: in the case of non-RDBMS datastores there is simply a "column" in the `ACCOUNT` "table", storing the "id" of the related object


[[many_one_uni_join]]
== Unidirectional (JoinTable)

NOTE: Supported for RDBMS. Other datastores simply ignore the join table and store the relation in a column in the table of the object with the field.

For this case we have the same 2 classes, *User* and *Account*, as before.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

so the *Account* class ("N" side) knows about the *User* class ("1" side), but not vice-versa, and are using a join table. 
A particular user could be related to several accounts. If you define the annotations for these classes as follows

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinTable(name="ACCOUNT_USER")
    User user;

    ....
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity-mappings>
    <entity class="User">
        <table name="USER"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="USER_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
        </attributes>
    </entity>

    <entity class="Account">
        <table name="ACCOUNT"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="ACCOUNT_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
            <many-to-one name="user">
                <join-table name="ACCOUNT_USER"/>
            </many-to-one>
        </attributes>
    </entity>
</entity-mappings>
-----

alternatively using annotations

This will create 3 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*), and a join table `ACCOUNT_USER`, as shown below.

NOTE: For non-RDBMS datastores there is no join-table, simply a "column" in the `ACCOUNT` "table", storing the "id" of the related object


[[many_one_bi_fk]]
== Bidirectional (ForeignKey)

This relationship is described in the guide for link:mapping.html#one_many_relations[1-N relationships]. 
This link:mapping.html#one_many_fk_bi[relation] uses a Foreign Key in the "N" object to hold the relationship. 

NOTE: For non-RDBMS datastores each side will have a "column" (or equivalent) in the "table" of the N side storing the "id" of the related (owning) object.


[[many_one_bi_join]]
== Bidirectional (JoinTable)

This relationship is described in the guide for link:mapping.html#one_many_relations[1-N relationships]. 
This link:mapping.html#one_many_join_bi[relation] uses a Join Table to link to the "N" object, with this table holding the relationship. 

NOTE: For non-RDBMS datastores there is no join table, and each side will have a "column" (or equivalent) in the "table", storing the "id" of the related object(s).
