A datastore identifier is a simple name of a database object, such as a column, table, index, or view, and is composed of a
sequence of letters, digits, and underscores ( _ ) that represents it's name. DataNucleus allows users to specify the names of tables, 
columns, indexes etc but if the user doesn't specify these DataNucleus will generate names.

NOTE: Some identifiers are actually reserved keywords with RDBMS, meaning that to use them you have to quote them. DataNucleus Jakarta quotes these
automatically for you so you don't have to think about it, whereas other Jakarta Persistence providers force you to quote these yourself!


With RDBMS the generation of identifier names is controlled by an IdentifierFactory, and DataNucleus provides a default implementation for Jakarta Persistence.
You can link:../extensions/extensions.html#rdbms_identifierfactory[provide your own RDBMS IdentifierFactory plugin] to give your own preferred naming if so desired.
For RDBMS you set the _RDBMS IdentifierFactory_ by setting the persistence property _datanucleus.identifierFactory_. 
Set it to the symbolic name of the factory you want to use.

* link:#rdbms_jakarta[jakarta] RDBMS IdentifierFactory (default for Jakarta Persistence persistence for RDBMS)

With non-RDBMS the generation of identifier names is controlled by a NamingFactory and again a default implementation for Jakarta Persistence.
You can link:../extensions/extensions.html#identifier_namingfactory[provide your own NamingFactory plugin] to give your own preferred naming if so desired.
You set the _NamingFactory_ by setting the persistence property _datanucleus.identifier.namingFactory_ to give your own preferred naming if so desired. 
Set it to the symbolic name of the factory you want to use.

* link:#jakarta[jakarta] NamingFactory (default for Jakarta persistence for non-RDBMS)

In describing the different possible naming conventions available out of the box with DataNucleus we'll use the following example

[source,java]
-----
public class MyClass
{
    String myField1;
    Collection<MyElement> elements1; // Using join table
    Collection<MyElement> elements2; // Using foreign-key
}

class MyElement
{
    String myElementField;
    MyClass myClass2;
}

== NamingFactory 'jakarta'

The _NamingFactory_ "jakarta" aims at providing a naming policy consistent with the "Jakarta Persistence" specification.

Using the same example above, the rules in this _NamingFactory_ mean that, assuming that the user doesn't specify any <column> elements :-

* _MyClass_ will be persisted into a table named `MYCLASS` (unless entityName had been specified, in which case use that)
* When using datastore identity `MYCLASS` will have a column called `MYCLASS_ID`
* _MyClass.myField1_ will be persisted into a column called `MYFIELD1`
* _MyElement_ will be persisted into a table named `MYELEMENT`
* _MyClass.elements1_ will be persisted into a join table called `MYCLASS_MYELEMENT`
* `MYCLASS_ELEMENTS1` will have columns called `MYCLASS_MYCLASS_ID` (FK to owner table) and `ELEMENTS1_ELEMENT_ID` (FK to element table)
* _MyClass.elements2_ will be persisted into a column `ELEMENTS2_MYCLASS_ID` (FK to owner) table
* Any discriminator column will be called `DTYPE`
* Any index column in a List for field _MyClass.myField1_ will be called `MYFIELD1_ORDER`
* Any adapter column added to a join table to form part of the primary key will be called `IDX`
* Any version column for a table will be called `VERSION`

== Controlling the Case

The underlying datastore will define what case of identifiers are accepted. By default, DataNucleus will capitalise names (assuming that the datastore supports it). 
You can however influence the case used for identifiers. This is specifiable with the persistence property *datanucleus.identifier.case*, having the following values

* UpperCase: identifiers are in upper case
* LowerCase: identifiers are in lower case
* MixedCase: No case changes are made to the name of the identifier provided by the user (class name or metadata).

NOTE : Some datastores only support UPPERCASE or lowercase identifiers and so setting this parameter may have no effect if your database doesn't support that option.

NOTE : This case control only applies to DataNucleus-generated identifiers. If you provide your own identifiers for things like schema/catalog etc then you 
need to specify those using the case you wish to use in the datastore (including quoting as necessary)
