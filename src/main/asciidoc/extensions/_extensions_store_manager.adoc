DataNucleus provides support for persisting objects to particular datastores. It provides this capability via a "Store Manager". 
It provides a Store Manager plugin for many datastores (see below). You can extend DataNucleus's capabilities using the plugin extension 
*org.datanucleus.store_manager*.

== Interface

If you want to implement support for another datastore you can achieve it by implementating the StoreManager interface.
http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/store/StoreManager.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc]].

For a brief guide on starting support for a new datastore, follow this link:#howto[HOWTO]


== Plugin Specification

Once you have this implementation you then need to make the class available as a DataNucleus plugin. You do this by putting a file 
`plugin.xml` in your JAR at the root of the CLASSPATH. The file `plugin.xml` will look like this

[source,xml]
-----------
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<plugin id="mydomain.mystore" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    <extension point="org.datanucleus.store_manager">
        <store-manager class-name="mydomain.MyStoreManager" url-key="mykey" key="mykey"/>
    </extension>
</plugin>
-----------

Note that you also require a MANIFEST.MF file as xref:extensions.adoc#MANIFEST[described above].

== Plugin Usage

The only thing remaining is to use your StoreManager. To do this you simply define your ConnectionURL to start with the _mykey_ defined in the plugin spec 
(for example, with the RDBMS plugin, the connection URL starts _jdbc:db-name:..._. This will select your store manager based on that.

== HOWTO Support A New Datastore

The process of adding support for a new datastore is simple in concept. It has particular components that can be supported or not. 
You don't have to support everything at once. The following gives guidelines on how to do it

* Is there a supported datastore that is similar in terms of its access ? If so, copy the existing datastore plugin (renaming packages etc). 
For example to support another OODB, you could take the "datanucleus-neodatis" plugin as a start point. Develop the XXXStoreManager class. 
*You are recommended to extend* _org.datanucleus.store.AbstractStoreManager_. Make sure you specify the _getSupportedOptions()_ method specifying what is supported.
* Develop the ConnectionFactoryImpl. This provides connectivity to the datastore. If the datastore has a simple connection that you open then commit then this 
file will be very simple. Again, copy an existing one if there is something suitable. 
*You are recommended to extend* _org.datanucleus.store.connection.AbstractConnectionFactory_ 
* Develop the PersistenceHandler. This provides the capability to do insert/update/delete/fetch/locate and so provides support for persistence to this datastore.
*You are recommended to extend* _org.datanucleus.store.AbstractPersistenceHandler_ 
* Does your datastore support the concept of a "schema" ? i.e you need to create some "table" in the datastore to store objects in? If so then you should implement the SchemaHandler.
*You are recommended to extend* _org.datanucleus.store.schema.AbstractStoreSchemaHandler_
* Develop the JDOQL/JPQL support. Make use of the _org.datanucleus.query_ classes. You need to decide how much of the query can be embodied in the native query language 
of the datastore. If you can't support some feature in the datastore native language then use the in-memory query evaluation
* Add on support for other features like inheritance strategy, discriminators, version checks, type converters as they are required.

As a guide, the basic connection, persistence could maybe be done in 2-4 days supporting "complete-table" only. 
To provide JDOQL or JPQL in-memory capability, you could do that in very short time also since the in-memory evaluator is done and the only thing you need to do is retrieve 
the candidate objects (of the candidate type). 
To provide JDOQL or JPQL in-datastore capability would take longer, how much would depend on the native query language structure for your datastore. 
Supporting things like other inheritance strategies may take significantly longer depending in the datastore.
