DataNucleus can discover the classes that it is managing at runtime, or you can define them in `persistence.xml`, 
or you can use an "auto-start" mechanism to inform DataNucleus of what classes it will be managing. 
DataNucleus provides 3 "auto-start" mechanisms, but also allows you to plugin your own variant using the plugin extension *org.datanucleus.autostart*.

== Interface

Any auto-start mechanism plugin will need to implement _org.datanucleus.store.AutoStartMechanism_.
image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/store/autostart/AutoStartMechanism.html]
So you need to implement the following interface

[source,java]
-----
package org.datanucleus.store.autostart;

public interface AutoStartMechanism
{
    /** mechanism is disabled if None **/ 
    public static final String NONE = "None";

    /** mechanism is in Quiet mode **/
    public static final String MODE_QUIET = "Quiet";

    /** mechanism is in Checked mode **/
    public static final String MODE_CHECKED = "Checked";

    /** mechanism is in Ignored mode **/
    public static final String MODE_IGNORED = "Ignored";

    /**
     * Accessor for the mode of operation.
     * @return The mode of operation
     **/
    String getMode();

    /**
     * Mutator for the mode of operation.
     * @param mode The mode of operation
     **/
    void setMode(String mode);

    /**
     * Accessor for the data for the classes that are currently auto started.
     * @return Collection of {@link StoreData} elements
     * @throws DatastoreInitialisationException
     **/
    Collection getAllClassData() throws DatastoreInitialisationException;

    /**
     * Starts a transaction for writing (add/delete) classes to the auto start mechanism.
     */
    void open();

    /**
     * Closes a transaction for writing (add/delete) classes to the auto start mechanism.
     */
    void close();

    /**
     * Whether it's open for writing (add/delete) classes to the auto start mechanism.
     * @return whether this is open for writing 
     */
    public boolean isOpen();

    /**
     * Method to add a class/field (with its data) to the currently-supported list.
     * @param data The data for the class.
     **/
    void addClass(StoreData data);

    /**
     * Method to delete a class/field that is currently listed as supported in
     * the internal storage.
     * It does not drop the schema of the DatastoreClass 
     * neither the contents of it. It only removes the class from the 
     * AutoStart mechanism.
     * TODO Rename this method to allow for deleting fields
     * @param name The name of the class/field
     **/
    void deleteClass(String name);

    /**
     * Method to delete all classes that are currently listed as supported in
     * the internal storage. It does not drop the schema of the DatastoreClass 
     * neither the contents of it. It only removes the classes from the 
     * AutoStart mechanism.
     **/
    void deleteAllClasses();

    /**
     * Utility to return a description of the storage for this mechanism.
     * @return The storage description.
     **/
    String getStorageDescription();
}
-----

You can extend _org.datanucleus.store.AbstractAutoStartMechanism_.


== Implementation

So lets assume that you want to create your own auto-starter __MyAutoStarter__.

[source,java]
-----
package mydomain;

import org.datanucleus.store.AutoStartMechanism;
import org.datanucleus.store.AbstractAutoStartMechanism;
import org.datanucleus.store.StoreManager;
import org.datanucleus.ClassLoaderResolver;

public class MyAutoStarter extends AbstractAutoStartMechanism
{
    public MyAutoStarter(StoreManager storeMgr, ClassLoaderResolver clr)
    {
        super();
    }

    ... (implement the required methods)
}
-----


== Plugin Specification

When we have defined our "AutoStartMechanism" we just need to make it into a DataNucleus plugin. 
To do this you simply add a file `plugin.xml` to your JAR at the root. The file `plugin.xml` should look like this

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<plugin id="mydomain" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    <extension point="org.datanucleus.autostart">
        <autostart name="myStarter" class-name="mydomain.MyAutoStarter"/>
    </extension>
</plugin>
-----

Note that you also require a MANIFEST.MF file as xref:extensions.adoc#MANIFEST[described above].


== Plugin Usage

The only thing remaining is to use your new _AutoStartMechanism_ plugin. You do this by having your plugin in the CLASSPATH at runtime, 
and setting the persistence property *datanucleus.autoStartMechanism* to _myStarter_ (the name you specified in the `plugin.xml` file).
