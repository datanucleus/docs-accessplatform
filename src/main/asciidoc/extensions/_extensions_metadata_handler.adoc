DataNucleus has supported XML metadata from the outset. 
More than this, it actually provides a pluggable framework whereby you can plug in your own XML MetaData support. 
DataNucleus provides JDO XML support (in `datanucleus-api-jdo`), JPA XML support (in `datanucleus-api-jpa`), as well as `persistence.xml` (in `datanucleus-core`).
You can extend DataNucleus's capabilities using the plugin extension *org.datanucleus.metadata_handler*.
