DataNucleus comes with built-in support for three Level 1 caches (weak, soft and strong references), but this is also an extension point so that you can easily 
add your own variant and have it usable within your DataNucleus usage.

You can extend DataNucleus's capabilities using the plugin extension *org.datanucleus.cache_level1*. 

The following sections describe how to create your own Level 1 cache plugin for DataNucleus.

== Interface

If you have your own Level1 cache you can easily use it with DataNucleus. DataNucleus defines a Level1Cache interface and you need to implement this.
image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/cache/Level1Cache.html].

[source,java]
-----
package org.datanucleus.cache;

public interface Level1Cache extends Map
{
}
-----

So you need to create a class, __MyLevel1Cache__ for example, that implements this interface (i.e that implements _java.util.Map_).


== Plugin Specification

Once you have this implementation you then need to make the class available as a DataNucleus plugin. 
You do this by putting a file `plugin.xml` in your JAR at the root of the CLASSPATH, like this

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<plugin id="mydomain.mycache" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    <extension point="org.datanucleus.cache_level1">
        <cache name="MyCache" class-name="mydomain.MyLevel1Cache"/>
    </extension>
</plugin>
-----

Note that you also require a `MANIFEST.MF` file as xref:extensions.adoc#MANIFEST[described above].

== Plugin Usage

The only thing remaining is to use your L1 Cache plugin. 
To do this you specify the persistence property *datanucleus.cache.level1.type* as __MyCache__ (the "name" in `plugin.xml`).
