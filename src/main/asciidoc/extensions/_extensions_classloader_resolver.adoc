DataNucleus allows specification of a class-loader resolver at runtime. 
It provides its own "built-in" resolver (_org.datanucleus.ClassLoaderResolverImpl_) that matches the requirements of the JDO spec (and following what the JPA spec needs), 
but this capability is extensible.
You can extend DataNucleus's capabilities using the plugin extension *org.datanucleus.classloader_resolver*.

== Built-in Implementation

At runtime, DataNucleus will need to load the classes being persisted. To do this it needs to utilise a particular class loading mechanism. 
The JDO specification defines how class-loading is to operate in a JDO implementation and this is what DataNucleus uses by default. 
In brief the JDO class-loading mechanism utilises 3 class loaders

* When creating the PersistenceManagerFactory you can specify a class loader. This is used first if specified
* The second class loader to try is the class loader for the current thread.
* The third class loader to try is the class loader for the PMF context.

If a class cannot be loaded using these three loaders then an exception is typically thrown depending on the operation.

== Interface

Any identifier factory plugin will need to implement _org.datanucleus.ClassLoaderResolver_.
http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/ClassLoaderResolver.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc]].
So you need to implement the following interface

[source,java]
-----
package org.datanucleus;

public interface ClassLoaderResolver
{
    /**
     * Class loading method, allowing specification of a primary loader. 
     * This method does not initialize the class
     * @param name Name of the Class to be loaded
     * @param primary the primary ClassLoader to use (or null)
     * @return The Class given the name, using the specified ClassLoader
     * @throws ClassNotResolvedException if the class can't be found in the classpath
     */
    public Class classForName(String name, ClassLoader primary);

        /**
     * Class loading method, allowing specification of a primary loader
     * and whether the class should be initialised or not.

     * @param initialize whether to initialize the class or not.
     * @return The Class given the name, using the specified ClassLoader
     * @throws ClassNotResolvedException if the class can't be found in the classpath
     */
    public Class classForName(String name, ClassLoader primary, boolean initialize);

    /**

    public Class classForName(String name);

    /**

     */
    public Class classForName(String name, boolean initialize);

    public boolean isAssignableFrom(String class_name_1, Class class_2);

     */
    public boolean isAssignableFrom(String class_name_1, String class_name_2);
    
    /**

    /**

    void unsetPrimary();
}
-----

Be aware that you can extend _org.datanucleus.ClassLoaderResolverImpl_ if you just want to change some behaviour of the default loader process. 
Your class loader resolver should provide a constructor taking an argument of type _ClassLoader_ which will be the loader that the 
PM/EM is using at initialisation (your class can opt to not use this, but must provide the constructor)


== Implementation

Let's suppose you want to provide your own resolver _MyClassLoaderResolver_

[source,java]
-----
package mydomain;

import org.datanucleus.ClassLoaderResolver;

public class MyClassLoaderResolver implements ClassLoaderResolver
{
    /**
     * Constructor for PersistenceManager cases.
     * @param pmLoader Loader from PM initialisation time.
     */
    public MyClassLoaderResolver(ClassLoader pmLoader)
    {
         ...
    }

    .. (implement the interface)
}
-----

== Plugin Specification

When we have defined our "IdentifierFactory" we just need to make it into a DataNucleus plugin.
To do this you simply add a file `plugin.xml` to your JAR at the root, like this

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<plugin id="mydomain" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    <extension point="org.datanucleus.classloader_resolver">
        <class-loader-resolver name="myloader" class-name="mydomain.MyClassLoaderResolver"/>
    </extension>
</plugin>
-----

Note that you also require a `MANIFEST.MF` file as xref:extensions.adoc#MANIFEST[described above].

== Plugin Usage

The only thing remaining is to use your new _ClassLoaderResolver_ plugin. You do this by having your plugin in the CLASSPATH at runtime, 
and setting the PMF property __datanucleus.classLoaderResolverName__ to _myloader_ (the name you specified in the `plugin.xml` file).
