DataNucleus supports locking of objects at database level.
Objects can be locked based on their object ID or based on the StateManager object directly.
The implementation of how this locking is done is handled by the LockManager.

The LockManager also implements methods used for versioning with optimistic locking.

If you for some reason want to modify the default LockManager behaviour you can do so by creating your own LockManager implementation using the plugin extension *org.datanucleus.lockmanager*.

The following sections describe how to create your own LockManager plugin for DataNucleus.

== Interface

To make your own LockManager you need to implement this.
image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/state/LockManager.html].

[source,java]
-----
package org.datanucleus.state;
public interface LockManager
{
    void lock(DNStateManager sm, LockMode lockMode);

    void unlock(DNStateManager sm);

    LockMode getLockMode(DNStateManager sm);

    void lock(Object id, LockMode lockMode);

    LockMode getLockMode(Object id);

    void clear();

    void close();

    void performOptimisticVersionCheck(DNStateManager sm, VersionStrategy versionStrategy, Object versionDatastore);

    Object getNextVersion(VersionMetaData vermd, Object currentVersion);
}

-----


== Implementation

Let's suppose your want to implement your own LockManager _MyLockManager_.
Note that you can also choose to extend the default LockManager and only override what you need.
The default LockManager is in org.datanucleus.state.LockManagerImpl.

[source,java]
-----
package mydomain;

import org.datanucleus.NucleusContext;
import org.datanucleus.state.LockManager;

public class MyLockManager implements LockManager
{
    /**
     * Constructor.
     * @param ec Execution Context
     */
    public MyTestLockManager(ExecutionContext ec)
    {
        ...
    }

    ... (implement the interface)
}
-----


== Plugin Specification

Once you have this implementation you then need to make the class available as a DataNucleus plugin.
You do this by putting a file `plugin.xml` in your JAR at the root of the CLASSPATH, like this

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<plugin id="mydomain" name="DataNucleus plug-ins" provider-name="My Company">
    <extension point="org.datanucleus.lockmanager">
        <lockmanager name="MyLockManagerName" class-name="mydomain.MyLockManager"/>
    </extension>
</plugin>
-----

Note that you also require a `MANIFEST.MF` file as xref:extensions.adoc#MANIFEST[described above].


== Plugin Usage

The only thing remaining is to use your LockManager plugin.
To do this you specify the persistence property *datanucleus.lockmanager.type* as __MyLockManagerName__ (the "name" in `plugin.xml`).
