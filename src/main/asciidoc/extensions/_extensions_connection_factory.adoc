Any plugin for a datastore needs a way of connecting to the datastore and linking these connections into the persistence process. This is provided by way of a ConnectionFactory.
This is extensible so you can define your own and register it for the datastore, and you use the plugin extension *org.datanucleus.store_connectionfactory*.
This extension point is intended to be implemented by provider of the datastore plugin. 
A datastore will typically operate with 2 _ConnectionFactorys_, one for transactional operations and one for non-transactional operations.


== Interface

Any Connection Factory plugin will need to implement _org.datanucleus.store.connection.ConnectionFactory_.
image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/store/connection/ConnectionFactory.html]
So you need to implement the following interface

[source,java]
-----
public interface ConnectionFactory
{
    /**
     * Obtain a connection from the Factory. 
     * The connection will be enlisted within the {@link org.datanucleus.Transaction} associated to the ExecutionContext if "enlist" is set to true.
     * @param om the ObjectManager
     * @param options Any options for then creating the connection
     * @return the ManagedConnection
     */
    ManagedConnection getConnection(ExecutionContext ec, org.datanucleus.Transaction transaction, Map options);

    /**
     * Create the ManagedConnection. Only used by ConnectionManager so do not call this.
     * @param ec ExecutionContext (if any)
     * @param transactionOptions the Transaction options this connection will be enlisted to, null if non existent
     * @return The ManagedConnection.
     */
    ManagedConnection createManagedConnection(ExecutionContext ec, Map transactionOptions);
}
-----

== Plugin Specification

So we now have our custom "Connection Factory" and we just need to make this into a DataNucleus plugin. 
To do this you simply add a file `plugin.xml` to your JAR at the root. The file `plugin.xml` should look like this

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<plugin id="mydomain.connectionfactory" name="My DataNucleus plug-in" provider-name="MyCompany">
    <extension point="org.datanucleus.store_connectionfactory">
        <connectionfactory name="rdbms/tx" class-name="org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.ConnectionFactoryImpl" transactional="true" datastore="rdbms"/>
        <connectionfactory name="rdbms/nontx" class-name="org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.ConnectionFactoryImpl" transactional="false" datastore="rdbms"/>
    </extension>
</plugin>
-----

Note that you also require a MANIFEST.MF file as xref:extensions.adoc#MANIFEST[described above].

So now for the datastore "rdbms" we will use this implementation when transactional or non-transactional

== Lifecycle

The _ConnectionFactory_ instance(s) are created when the StoreManager is instantiated and held as hard references during the lifecycle of the StoreManager.
