== Mapping : LDAP Datastore Mapping

When persisting a Java object to an LDAP datastore clearly the user would like some control over where and how in the 
LDAP DIT (directory information tree) we are persisting the object.
In general Java objects are mapped to LDAP entries and fields of the Java objects are mapped to attributes of the LDAP entries. 

The following Java types are supported and stored as single-valued attribute to the LDAP entry:

* String, primitives (like int and double), wrappers of primitives (like java.util.Long), java.util.BigDecimal, java.util.BigInteger, java.util.UUID
* boolean and java.lang.Boolean are converted to RFC 4517 "boolean" syntax (TRUE or FALSE)
* java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar are converted to RFC 4517 "generalized time" syntax

Arrays, Collections, Sets and Lists of these data types are stored as multi-valued attributes. 
Please note that when using Arrays and Lists no order could be guaranteed and no duplicate values are allowed!


== Mapping : Relationships

By default persistable objects are stored as separate LDAP entries. There are some options how to persist relationship references between persistable objects:

* link:#ldap_mapping_by_dn[DN matching]
* link:#ldap_mapping_by_attribute[Attribute matching]
* link:#ldap_mapping_by_hierarchy[LDAP hierarchies (DEPRECATED)]

It is also possible to store persistable objects link:#ldap_mapping_as_embedded[embedded].
Note that there is inbuilt logic for deciding which of these mapping strategies to use for a relationship. 
You can explicitly set this with the metadata extension for the field/property _mapping-strategy_ and it can be set to *dn* or *attribute*.


== Examples

Here's an example using JDO XML MetaData:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="mydomain.model.company">
        <class name="Group" table="ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,groupOfNames" detachable="true">
            <field name="name" column="cn" primary-key="true" />
            <field name="users" column="member" />
        </class>

        <class name="Person" table="ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson" detachable="true">
            <field name="personNum" column="cn" primary-key="true" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenMame" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

For the class as a whole we use the *table* attribute  to set the _distinguished name_  of the container under which to store objects of a type. 
So, for example, we are mapping all objects of class Group as subordinates to "ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com".
You can also use the extension "dn" to specify the same thing.

For the class as a whole we use the *schema* attribute to define the object classes of the LDAP entry. 
So, for example, all objects of type Person are mapped to the common "top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson" object classes in LDAP.
You can also use the extension "objectClass" to specify the same thing.

For each field we use the *column* attribute to define the _LDAP attribute_ that we are mapping this field to. 
So, for example, we map the Group "name" to "cn" in our LDAP.
You can also use the extension "attribute" to specify the same thing.

Some resulting LDAP entries would look like this: 

-----
dn: cn=Sales,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: groupOfNames
cn: Sales
member: cn=1,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com

dn: cn=1,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
cn: 1
givenName: Bugs
sn: Bunny
-----

Here's the same example using JDO Annotations:

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable(table="ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com", schema="top,groupOfNames")
public class Group
{
    @PrimaryKey
    @Column(name = "cn")
    String name;

    @Column(name = "member")
    protected Set<Person> users = new HashSet<>();
}

@PersistenceCapable(table="ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com", schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson")
public class Person
{
    @PrimaryKey
    @Column(name = "cn")
    private long personNum;

    @Column(name = "givenName")
    private String firstName;

    @Column(name = "sn")
    private String lastName;
}
-----

Here's the same example using JPA/Jakarta Annotations:

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@Table(name="ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com", schema="top,groupOfNames")
public class Group
{
    @Id
    @Extension(key="attribute", value="cn")
    String name;

    @OneToMany
    @Extension(key="attribute", value="member")
    protected Set users = new HashSet();
}

@Entity
@Table(name="ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com", schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson")
public class Person
{
    @Id
    @Extension(key="attribute", value="roomNumber")
    private long personNum;

    @Extension(key="attribute", value="cn")
    private String firstName;

    @Extension(key="attribute", value="sn")
    private String lastName;
}
-----


== Known Limitations

The following are known limitations of the current implementation

* Datastore Identity is not currently supported
* Optimistic checking of versions is not supported
* Identity generators that operate using the datastore are not supported
* Cannot map inherited classes to the same LDAP type



[[ldap_mapping_by_dn]]
== LDAP : Relationship Mapping by DN

A common way to model relationships between LDAP entries is to put the LDAP distinguished name of the referenced LDAP
entry to an attribute of the referencing LDAP entry. For example entries with object class groupOfNames use the attribute
_member_ which contains distinguished names of the group members.

We just describe 1-N relationship mapping here and distinguish between unidirectional and bidirectional relationships. 
The metadata for 1-1, N-1 and M-N relationship mapping looks identical, the only difference is whether single-valued or
multi-valued attributes are used in LDAP to store the relationships. 

* link:#ldap_dn_unidirectional[Unidirectional]
* link:#ldap_dn_bidirectional[Bidirectional]


[[ldap_dn_unidirectional]]
=== Mapping by DN : 1-N Unidirectional

We use the following example LDAP tree and Java classes:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Department {
|                                                           String name;
|-- ou=Departments                                          Set<Employee> employees;
|   |-- cn=Sales                                        }
|   |-- cn=Engineering                                  
|   |-- ...                                             public class Employee {
|                                                           String firstName;
|-- ou=Employees                                            String lastName;
|   |-- cn=Bugs Bunny                                       String fullName;
|   |-- cn=Daffy Duck                                   }
|   |-- cn=Speedy Gonzales                              
|   |-- ...                                             
-----

We have a flat LDAP tree with one container for all the departments and one container for all the employees.
We have two Java classes, *Department* and *Employee*. The *Department* class contains a
Collection of type *Employee*. The *Employee* knows nothing about the *Department* it belongs to.

There are 2 ways that we can persist this relationship in LDAP because the DN reference could be stored at the one or at the other LDAP entry.

==== Owner Object Side

The obvious way is to store the reference at the owner object side, in our case at the department entry. 
This is possible since LDAP allows multi-valued attributes. The example department entry looks like this:

-----
dn: cn=Sales,ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: groupOfNames
cn: Sales
member: cn=Bugs Bunny,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
member: cn=Daffy Duck,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
-----

Our JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,groupOfNames">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="cn" />
            <field name="employees" column="member">
                <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="empty-value" value="uid=admin,ou=system"/>
            </field>
        </class>
        <class name="Employee" table="ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

So we define that the attribute _member_ should be used to persist the relationship of field _employees_.

Note: We use the extension _empty-value_ here. The groupOfNames object class defines the member attribute as mandatory attribute. 
In case where you remove all the employees from a department would delete all member attributes which isn't allowed. 
In that case DataNucleus adds this empty value to the member attribute. 
This value is also filtered when DataNucleus reads the object from LDAP.


==== Non-Owner Object Side

Another possible way is to store the reference at the non-owner object side, in our case at the employee entry.
The example employee entry looks like this:

-----
dn: cn=Bugs Bunny,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
cn: Bugs Bunny
givenName: Bugs
sn: Bunny
departmentNumber: cn=Sales,ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com
-----

Our JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,groupOfNames">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="cn" />
            <field name="employees">
                <element column="departmentNumber" />
            </field>
        </class>
        <class name="Employee" table="ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

We need to define the relationship at the department metadata because the employee doesn't know about the department it belongs to. 
With the _<element>_ tag we specify that the relationship should be persisted at the other side, the _column_ attribute defines the LDAP attribute to use. 
In this case the relationship is persisted in the _departmentNumber_ attribute at the employee entry.


[[ldap_dn_bidirectional]]
=== Mapping by DN : 1-N Bidirectional

We use the following example LDAP tree and Java classes:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Department {
|                                                           String name;
|-- ou=Departments                                          Set<Employee> employees;
|   |-- cn=Sales                                        }
|   |-- cn=Engineering                                  
|   |-- ...                                             public class Employee {
|                                                           String firstName;
|-- ou=Employees                                            String lastName;
|   |-- cn=Bugs Bunny                                       String fullName;
|   |-- cn=Daffy Duck                                       Department department;
|   |-- cn=Speedy Gonzales                              }
|   |-- ...                                             
-----

We have a flat LDAP tree with one container for all the departments and one container for all the employees.
We have two Java classes, *Department* and *Employee*. 
The *Department* class contains a Collection of type *Employee*. Now each *Employee* has a reference to its *Department*.

It is possible to persist this relationship on both sides.

-----
dn: cn=Sales,ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: groupOfNames
cn: Sales
member: cn=Bugs Bunny,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
member: cn=Daffy Duck,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
-----

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,groupOfNames">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="cn" />
            <field name="employees" column="member">
                <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="empty-value" value="uid=admin,ou=system"/>
            </field>
        </class>
        <class name="Employee" table="ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="department" mapped-by="employees" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

In this case we store the relation at the department entry side in a multi-valued attribute _member_.
Now the employee metadata contains a department field that is _mapped-by_ the employees field of department.

Note: We use the extension _empty-value_ here. The groupOfNames object class defines the member attribute as mandatory attribute. 
In case where you remove all the employees from a department would delete all member attributes which isn't allowed. 
In that case DataNucleus adds this empty value to the member attribute. 
This value is also filtered when DataNucleus reads the object from LDAP.


[[ldap_mapping_by_attribute]]
== LDAP : Relationship Mapping by Attribute

Another way to model relationships between LDAP entries is to use attribute matching. This means two entries have the same
attribute values. An example of this type of relationship is used by posixGroup and posixAccount object classes were posixGroup.memberUid points to posicAccount.uid.

We just describe 1-N relationship mapping here and distinguish between unidirectional and bidirectional relationships. 
The metadata for 1-1, N-1 and M-N relationship mapping looks identical, the only difference is whether single-valued or
multi-valued attributes are used in LDAP to store the relationships.

[[ldap_attribute_unidirectional]]
=== Mapping by Attribute: 1-N Unidirectional

We use the following example LDAP tree and Java classes:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Department {
|                                                           String name;
|-- ou=Departments                                          Set<Employee> employees;
|   |-- ou=Sales                                        }
|   |-- ou=Engineering                                  
|   |-- ...                                             public class Employee {
|                                                           String firstName;
|-- ou=Employees                                            String lastName;
|   |-- uid=bbunny                                          String fullName;
|   |-- uid=dduck                                           String uid;
|   |-- uid=sgonzales                                   }
|   |-- ...                                             
-----

We have a flat LDAP tree with one container for all the departments and one container for all the employees.
We have two Java classes, *Department* and *Employee*. The *Department* class contains a
Collection of type *Employee*. The *Employee* knows nothing about the *Department* it belongs to.

There are 2 ways that we can persist this relationship in LDAP because the reference could be stored at the one or at the other LDAP entry.

==== Owner Object Side

One way is to store the reference at the owner object side, in our case at the department entry. 
This is possible since LDAP allows multi-valued attributes. The example department entry looks like this:

-----
dn: ou=Sales,ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: organizationalUnit
objectClass: extensibleObject
ou: Sales
memberUid: bbunny
memberUid: dduck
-----

Our JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,organizationalUnit,extensibleObject">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="ou" />
            <field name="employees" column="memberUid">
                <join column="uid" />
            </field>
        </class>
        <class name="Employee" table="ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
        
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="uid" column="uid" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

So we define that the attribute _memberUid_ at the department entry should be used to persist the relationship of field _employees_ 

The important thing here is the _<join>_ tag and its _column_.
Firstly it signals DataNucleus to use attribute mapping. 
Secondly it specifies the attribute at the other side that should be used for relationship mapping.
In our case, when we establish a relationship between a *Department* and an *Employee*,
the _uid_ value of the employee entry is stored in the _memberUid_ attribute of the department entry.

==== Non-Owner Object Side

Another possible way is to store the reference at the non-owner object side, in our case at the employee entry.
The example employee entry looks like this:

-----
dn: uid=bbunny,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
uid: bbunny
cn: Bugs Bunny
givenName: Bugs
sn: Bunny
departmentNumber: Sales
-----

Our JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,organizationalUnit">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="ou" />
            <field name="employees">
                <element column="departmentNumber" />
                <join column="ou" />
            </field>
        </class>
        <class name="Employee" table="ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="uid" column="uid" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

We need to define the relationship at the department metadata because the employee doesn't know about the department it belongs to.

With the _<element>_ tag we specify that the relationship should be persisted at the other side and the _column_ attribute defines the LDAP attribute to use. 
In this case the relationship is persisted in the _departmentNumber_ attribute at the employee entry.

The important thing here is the _<join>_ tag and its _column_.
As before it signals DataNucleus to use attribute mapping.
Now, as the relation is persisted at the <u>other</u> side, it specifies the attribute at <u>this</u> side that should be used for relationship mapping.
In our case, when we establish a relationship between a *Department* and an *Employee*, the _ou_ value of the department entry is stored in the _departmentNumber_ attribute of the employee entry.



[[ldap_attribute_bidirectional]]
=== Mapping by Attribute : 1-N Bidirectional

We use the following example LDAP tree and Java classes:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Department {
|                                                           String name;
|-- ou=Departments                                          Set<Employee> employees;
|   |-- ou=Sales                                        }
|   |-- ou=Engineering                                  
|   |-- ...                                             public class Employee {
|                                                           String firstName;
|-- ou=Employees                                            String lastName;
|   |-- uid=bbunny                                          String fullName;
|   |-- uid=dduck                                           String uid;
|   |-- uid=sgonzales                                       Department department;
|   |-- ...                                             }
-----

We have a flat LDAP tree with one container for all the departments and one container for all the employees.
We have two Java classes, *Department* and *Employee*. The *Department* class contains a
Collection of type *Employee*. Now each *Employee* has a reference to its *Department*.

It is possible to persist this relationship on both sides.

-----
dn: uid=bbunny,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
uid: bbunny
cn: Bugs Bunny
givenName: Bugs
sn: Bunny
departmentNumber: Sales

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,organizationalUnit">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="ou" />
            <field name="employees" mapped-by="department" />
        </class>
        <class name="Employee" table="ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="uid" column="uid" />
            <field name="department" column="departmentNumber">
                <join column="ou" />
            </field>
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

In this case we store the relation at the employee entry side in a single-valued attribute _departmentNumber_. 
With the _<join>_ tag and its _column_ we specify that the _ou_ value of the department entry should be used as join value. 
Also note that _employee_ field of *Department* is _mapped-by_ the _department_ field of the *Employee*.


[[ldap_mapping_by_hierarchy]]
== LDAP : Relationship Mapping by Hierarchy (DEPRECATED)

As LDAP is a hierarchical data store it is possible to model relationships between LDAP entries using hierarchies. 
For example organisational structures like departments and their employees are often modeled hierarchical in LDAP. 
It is possible to map 1-1 and N-1/1-N relationships using LDAP hierarchies.

The main challenge with hierarchical mapping is that the distinguished name (DN) of children depends 
on the DN of their parent. Therefore each child class needs a reference to the parent class. 
The parent class metadata defines a (fixed) LDAP DN that is used as container for all objects of the parent type.
The child class metadata contains a dynamic part in its DN definition. This dynamic part contains the name of 
the field holding the reference to the parent object, the name is surrounded by curly braces.
This dynamic DN is the indicator for DataNucleus to use hierarchical mapping.
The reference field itself won't be persisted as attribute because it is used as dynamic parameter.
If you query for child objects DataNucleus starts a larger LDAP search to find the objects 
(the container DN of the parent class as search base and subtree scope).

NOTE: Child objects are automatically dependent. If you delete the parent object all child objects are automatically deleted. 
If you null out the child object reference in the parent object or if you remove the child object from the parents collection, the child object is automatically deleted.


=== Mapping by Hierarchy : N-1 Unidirectional (DEPRECATED)

This kind of mapping could be used if your LDAP tree has a huge number of child objects and you only work with these child objects. 

We use the following example LDAP tree and Java classes:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Department {
|                                                           String name;
|-- ou=Sales                                            }
|   |-- cn=Bugs Bunny                                   
|   |-- cn=Daffy Duck                                   public class Employee {
|   |-- ...                                                 String firstName;
|                                                           String lastName;
|-- ou=Engineering                                          String fullName;
|   |-- cn=Speedy Gonzales                                  Department department;
|   |-- ...                                             }
|                                                       
|-- ...                                                 
-----

In the LDAP tree we have departments (Sales and Engineering) and each department holds some associated employees. 
In our Java classes each *Employee* object knows its *Department* but not vice-versa.

The JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,organizationalUnit">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="ou" />
        </class>

        <class name="Employee" table="{department}" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="department"/>
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

The *Department* objects are persisted directly under _dc=example,dc=com_.
The *Employee* class has a dynamic DN definition _{department}_. So the DN of the Department instance is used as container for Employee objects.



=== Mapping by Hierarchy : N-1 (1-N) Bidirectional (DEPRECATED)

If you need a reference from the parent object to the child objects you need to define a bidirectional relationship.

The example LDAP tree and Java classes looks like this:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Department {
|                                                           String name;
|-- ou=Sales                                                Set<Employee> employees;
|   |-- cn=Bugs Bunny                                   }
|   |-- cn=Daffy Duck                                   
|   |-- ...                                             public class Employee {
|                                                           String firstName;
|-- ou=Engineering                                          String lastName;
|   |-- cn=Speedy Gonzales                                  String fullName;
|   |-- ...                                                 Department department;
|                                                       }
|-- ...                                                
-----

Now the *Department* class has a Collection containing references to its *Employee*s.

The JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Department" table="dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,organizationalUnit">
            <field name="name" primary-key="true" column="ou" />
            <field name="employees" mapped-by="department"/>
        </class>

        <class name="Employee" table="{department}" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="department"/>
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

We added a new _employees_ field to the Department class that is _mapped-by_ the department field  of the Employee class. 

Please note: When loading the parent object all child object are loaded immediately. 
For a large number of child entries this may lead to performance and/or memory problems.


=== Mapping by Hierarchy : 1-1 Unidirectional (DEPRECATED)

1-1 unidirectional mapping is very similar to N-1 unidirectional mapping. 

We use the following example LDAP tree and Java classes:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Person {
|                                                           String firstName;
|-- ou=People                                               String lastName;
|   |-- cn=Bugs Bunny                                       String fullName;
|   |   |-- uid=bbunny                                  }
|   |                                                   
|   |-- cn=Daffy Duck                                   public class Account {
|   |   |-- uid=dduck                                       String uid;
|   |                                                       String password;
|   |-- ...                                                 Person person;
                                                        }
-----

In the LDAP tree we have persons and each person has one account.
Each *Account* object knows to which *Person* it belongs to, but not vice-versa.

The JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Person" table="ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
        </class>
        
        <class name="Account" table="{person}" schema="top,account,simpleSecurityObject">
            <field name="uid" primary-key="true column="uid" />
            <field name="password" column="userPasword" />
            <field name="person" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

The *Person* objects are persisted directly under _ou=People,dc=example,dc=com_.
The *Account* class has a dynamic DN definition _{person}_. 
So the DN of the Person instance is used as container for the Account object.


=== Mapping by Hierarchy : 1-1 Bidirectional (DEPRECATED)

If you need a reference from the parent class to the child class you need to define a bidirectional relationship.

The example LDAP tree and Java classes looks like this:

-----
dc=example,dc=com                                       public class Person {
|                                                           String firstName;
|-- ou=People                                               String lastName;
|   |                                                       String fullName;
|   |-- cn=Bugs Bunny                                       Account account;
|   |   |-- uid=bbunny                                  }
|   |                                                   
|   |-- cn=Daffy Duck                                   public class Account {
|   |   |-- uid=dduck                                       String uid;
|   |                                                       String password;
|   |-- ...                                                 Person person;
                                                        }
-----

Now the *Person* class has a reference to its *Account*.

The JDO metadata looks like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Person" table="ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="account" mapped-by="person" />
        </class>
        
        <class name="Account" table="{person}" schema="top,account,simpleSecurityObject">
            <field name="uid" primary-key="true column="uid" />
            <field name="password" column="userPasword" />
            <field name="person" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

We added a new _account_ field to the Person class that is _mapped-by_ the person field of the Account class. 


[[ldap_mapping_as_embedded]]
== LDAP : Embedded Objects

With JDO it is possible to persist field(s) as embedded. This may be useful for LDAP datastores where often many attributes
are stored within one entry however logically they describe different objects.

Let's assume we have the following entry in our directory:

-----
dn: cn=Bugs Bunny,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
cn: Bugs Bunny
givenName: Bugs
sn: Bunny
postalCode: 3578
l: Hollywood
street: Sunset Boulevard
uid: bbunny
userPassword: secret
-----

This entry contains multiple type of information: a person, its address and its account data. So we will create the following Java classes:

[source,java]
-----
public class Employee {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
    String fullName;
    Address address;
    Account account;
}

public class Address {
    int zip;
    String city
    String street;
}

public class Account {
    String id;
    String password;
}
-----

The JDO metadata to map these objects to one LDAP entry would look like this:

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="com.example">
        <class name="Person" table="ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com" schema="top,person,organizationalPerson,inetOrgPerson">
            <field name="fullName" primary-key="true" column="cn" />
            <field name="firstName" column="givenName" />
            <field name="lastName" column="sn" />
            <field name="account">
                <embedded null-indicator-column="uid">
                    <field name="id" column="uid" />
                    <field name="password" column="userPassword" />
                </embedded>
            </field>
            <field name="address">
                <embedded null-indicator-column="l">
                    <field name="zip" column="postalCode" />
                    <field name="city" column="l" />
                    <field name="street" column="street" />
                </embedded>
            </field>
        </class>
        <class name="Account" embedded-only="true">
            <field name="uid" />
            <field name="password" />
        </class>
        <class name="Address" embedded-only="true">
            <field name="zip" />
            <field name="city" />
            <field name="street" />
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
