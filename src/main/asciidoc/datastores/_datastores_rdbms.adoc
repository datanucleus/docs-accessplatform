DataNucleus supports persistence to RDBMS datastores using the https://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-rdbms[datanucleus-rdbms] plugin. 
It supports the vast majority of RDBMS products available today, and uses JDBC.
RDBMS systems accept varying standards of SQL and so DataNucleus will support particular RDBMS/JDBC combinations only, though clearly we try to support as many as possible.
You need to have the JDBC driver for your RDBMS in the CLASSPATH.


By default when you create a PersistenceManagerFactory or EntityManagerFactory to connect to a particular datastore DataNucleus will automatically 
detect the _datastore adapter_ to use and will use its own internal adapter for that type of datastore. 
If you find that either DataNucleus has incorrectly detected the adapter to use, you can override the default behaviour using the persistence property
*datanucleus.rdbms.datastoreAdapterClassName*.

The following RDBMS have support built in to DataNucleus.

Note that if your RDBMS is not listed or currently supported you can easily write your own link:../extensions/extensions.html#rdbms_datastore_adapter[Datastore Adapter] for it
raise an issue in GitHub when you have it working and attach a patch to contribute it.
Similarly if you are using an adapter that has some problem on your case you could use the same plugin mechanism to override the non-working feature.


[[db2]]
== DB2

To specify DB2 as your datastore, define the connection URL as 

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:db2://localhost:50002/mydb1
-----

where "mydb1" is the name of the database. 

With DB2 Express-C v9.7 you need to have `db2jcc.jar` and `db2jcc_license_cu.jar` in the CLASSPATH.


[[mysql]]
== MySQL

To specify MySQL/MariaDB as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql://'host':'port'/'db-name'
-----


http://www.mysql.com[MySQL] and its more developed drop in replacement https://mariadb.org[MariaDB] are supported as an RDBMS datastore by DataNucleus with the following provisos

* You can set the table (engine) type for any created tables via persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.mysql.engineType* or by setting the 
extension metadata on a class with key _mysql-engine-type_. The default is INNODB
* You can set the collation type for any created tables via persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.mysql.collation*
or by setting the extension metadata on a class with key _mysql-collation_
* You can set the character set for any created tables via persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.mysql.characterSet*
or by setting the extension metadata on a class with key _mysql-character-set_
* JDOQL.isEmpty()/contains() will not work in MySQL 4.0 (or earlier) since the query uses EXISTS and that is only available from MySQL 4.1
* MySQL on Windows MUST specify *datanucleus.identifier.case* as "LowerCase" since the MySQL server stores all identifiers in lowercase 
BUT the mysql-connector-java JDBC driver has a bug (in versions up to and including 3.1.10) where it claims that the MySQL server stores things in mixed case when it doesnt
* MySQL 3.* will not work reliably with inheritance cases since DataNucleus requires UNION and this doesn't exist in MySQL 3.*
* MySQL before version 4.1 will not work correctly on JDOQL Collection.size(), Map.size() operations since this requires subqueries, which are not supported before MySQL 4.1.
* If you receive an error "Incorrect arguments to mysql_stmt_execute" then this is a bug in MySQL and you need to update your JDBC URL to append "?useServerPrepStmts=false".
* MySQL throws away the milliseconds on a Date and so cannot be used reliably for Optimistic locking using strategy "date-time" (use "version" instead)
* You can specify "BLOB", "CLOB" JDBC types when using MySQL with DataNucleus but you must turn validation of columns OFF. 
This is because these types are not supported by the MySQL JDBC driver and it returns them as LONGVARBINARY/LONGVARCHAR when querying the column type


[[sqlserver]]
== SQL Server

To specify SQLServer as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)
    
Microsoft SQLServer 2005 JDBC Driver (Recommended)
-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:sqlserver://'host':'port';DatabaseName='db-name';SelectMethod=cursor
-----

or using the older Microsoft SQLServer 2000 JDBC Driver
-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://'host':'port';DatabaseName='db-name';SelectMethod=cursor
-----
    
http://www.microsoft.com/sql[Microsoft SQLServer] is supported as an RDBMS datastore by DataNucleus with the following proviso

* SQLServer 2000 does not keep accuracy on _datetime_ datatypes. This is an SQLServer 2000 issue. In order to keep the accuracy when storing _java.util.Date_ java types, use _int_ datatype.



[[oracle]]
== Oracle

To specify http://www.oracle.com/database/[Oracle] as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc) ... 
you can also use 'oci' instead of 'thin' depending on your driver.

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@'host':'port':'db-name'
-----


[[sybase]]
== Sybase

To specify http://www.sybase.com[Sybase] as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:sybase:Tds:'host':'port'/'db-name'
-----


[[sqlanywhere]]
== SAP SQL Anywhere

To specify http://www.sap.com/pc/tech/database/software/sybase-sql-anywhere/index.html[SQL Anywhere] as your datastore, 
you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:sqlanywhere:uid=DBA;pwd=sql;eng=demo
-----


[[hsqldb]]
== HSQLDB

To specify HSQLDB (server) as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://'host':'port'/'db-name'
-----

or HSQLDB (in-memory) like this

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:'db-name'
-----

http://hsqldb.org[HSQLDB] is supported as an RDBMS datastore by DataNucleus with the following provisos

* Use of batched statements is disabled since HSQLDB has a bug where it throws exceptions "batch failed" (really informative). Still waiting for this to be fixed in HSQLDB
* Use of JDOQL/JPQL subqueries cannot be used where you want to refer back to the parent query since HSQLDB up to and including version 1.8 don't support this.



[[h2]]
== H2

http://www.h2database.com[H2] is supported as an RDBMS datastore by DataNucleus.

To specify H2 (embedded) as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:h2:mem:'db-name'
-----


[[informix]]
== Informix

To specify Informix as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:informix-sqli://[{ip|host}:port][/dbname]:INFORMIXSERVER=servername[;name=value[;name=value]...]
-----

For example
-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:informix-sqli://192.168.254.129:9088:informixserver=demo_on;database=buf_log_db
-----

Note that some database logging options in Informix do not allow changing autoCommit dinamically. You need to rebuild the database to support it. 
To rebuild the database refer to Informix documention, but as example, 
-----
run $INFORMIXDIR\bin\dbaccess and execute the command "CREATE DATABASE mydb WITH BUFFERED LOG".
-----
 
*INDEXOF*: Informix 11.x does not have a function to search a string in another string. 
DataNucleus defines a user defined function `DATANUCLEUS_STRPOS` which is automatically created on startup. 
The SQL for the UDF function is:

-----
create function DATANUCLEUS_STRPOS(str char(40),search char(40),from smallint) returning smallint
    define i,pos,lenstr,lensearch smallint;
    let lensearch = length(search);
    let lenstr = length(str);

    if lenstr=0 or lensearch=0 then return 0; end if;

    let pos=-1;
    for i=1+from to lenstr
        if substr(str,i,lensearch)=search then
            let pos=i;
            exit for;
        end if;
    end for;
    return pos;
end function;
-----


[[postgresql]]
== PostgreSQL

To specify http://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:postgresql://'host':'port'/'db-name'
-----


[[postgis]]
== PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension

To specify http://www.postgis.org[PostGIS] as your datastore, you will need to decide first which geometry library you want to use and then set the connection url accordingly.

For the PostGIS JDBC geometries you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:postgresql://'host':'port'/'db-name'
-----

For Oracle's JGeometry you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)
-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:postgres_jgeom://'host':'port'/'db-name'
-----

For the JTS (Java Topology Suite) geometries you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with name of your database etc)
-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:postgres_jts://'host':'port'/'db-name'
-----


[[derby]]
== Apache Derby

To specify http://db.apache.org/derby/[Apache Derby] as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with filename of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:derby:'db-name';create=true
-----

Above settings are used together with the Apache Derby in embedded mode. The below settings are used in network mode, where the default port number is 1527.

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:derby://'hostname':'portnumber'/'db-name';create=true
-----

*ASCII*: Derby 10.1 does not have a function to convert a char into ASCII code. DataNucleus needs such function to converts chars to int values when performing queries converting chars to ints. 
DataNucleus defines a defined function `NUCLEUS_ASCII`, which is automatically created on startup. The SQL for the UDF function is:

-----
DROP FUNCTION NUCLEUS_ASCII;
CREATE FUNCTION NUCLEUS_ASCII(C CHAR(1)) RETURNS INTEGER
EXTERNAL NAME 'org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.adapter.DerbySQLFunction.ascii'
CALLED ON NULL INPUT
LANGUAGE JAVA PARAMETER STYLE JAVA;
-----

*String.matches(pattern)*: When pattern argument is a column, DataNucleus defines a function `NUCLEUS_MATCHES` that allows Derby 10.1 to perform the matches function. The SQL for the UDF function is:

-----
DROP FUNCTION NUCLEUS_MATCHES;
CREATE FUNCTION NUCLEUS_MATCHES(TEXT VARCHAR(8000), PATTERN VARCHAR(8000)) RETURNS INTEGER
EXTERNAL NAME 'org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.adapter.DerbySQLFunction.matches'
CALLED ON NULL INPUT
LANGUAGE JAVA PARAMETER STYLE JAVA;
-----


[[firebird]]
== Firebird

To specify Firebird as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with filename of your database etc) 

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:firebirdsql://localhost/'db-name'
-----

http://www.firebirdsql.org[Firebird] is supported as an RDBMS datastore by DataNucleus with the proviso that

* Auto-table creation is severely limited with Firebird. In Firebird, DDL statements are not auto-committed and are executed at the end of a transaction, after any DML statements. 
This makes "on the fly" table creation in the middle of a DML transaction not work. 
You must make sure that "autoStartMechanism" is NOT set to "SchemaTable" since this will use DML. 
You must also make sure that nobody else is connected to the database at the same time.
Don't ask us why such limitations are in a RDBMS, but then it was you that chose to use this ;-)


[[nuodb]]
== NuoDB

To specify NuoDB as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with filename of your database etc) 

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:com.nuodb://localhost/'db-name'
-----


[[maxdb]]
== SAPDB/MaxDB

To specify SQLite as your datastore, you will need something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with filename of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:sqlite:'db-name'
-----

http://www.sqlite.org/[SQLite] is supported as an RDBMS datastore by DataNucleus with the proviso that

* When using sequences, you must set the persistence property *datanucleus.valuegeneration.transactionAttribute* to *EXISTING*

== Pointbase

To specify http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13218_01/wlp/docs92/db/pointbase.html#wp1058500[Pointbase] as your datastore, you will need 
something like the following specifying (replacing 'db-name' with filename of your database etc)

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:pointbase://127.0.0.1/{dbname}
-----




== JDBC Driver parameters

If you need to pass additional parameters to the JDBC driver you can append these to the end of the *datanucleus.ConnectionURL*. For example,

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql://localhost?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8
-----



[[statement_batching]]
== RDBMS : Statement Batching

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When changes are required to be made to an underlying RDBMS datastore, statements are sent via JDBC.
A statement is, in general, a single SQL command, and is then executed. 
In some circumstances the statements due to be sent to the datastore are the same JDBC statement several times. In this case the statement can be _batched_. 
This means that a statement is created for the SQL, and it is passed to the datastore with multiple sets of values before being executed. 
When it is executed the SQL is executed for each of the sets of values. 
DataNucleus allows statement batching under certain circumstances.

The maximum number of statements that can be included in a _batch_ can be set via a persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.statementBatchLimit*. This defaults to 50. 
If you set it to -1 then there is no maximum limit imposed. Setting it to 0 means that batching is turned off.

*It should be noted that while batching sounds essential, it is only of any possible use when the exact same SQL is required to be executed more than 1 times in a row. 
If a different SQL needs executing between 2 such statements then no batching is possible anyway.*. Let's take an example

-----
INSERT INTO MYTABLE VALUES(?,?,?,?)
INSERT INTO MYTABLE VALUES(?,?,?,?)
SELECT ID, NAME FROM MYOTHERTABLE WHERE VALUE=?
INSERT INTO MYTABLE VALUES(?,?,?,?)
SELECT ID, NAME FROM MYOTHERTABLE WHERE VALUE=?
-----

In this example the first two statements can be batched together since they are identical and nothing else separates them.
All subsequent statements cannot be batched since no two identical statements follow each other.

The statements that DataNucleus currently allows for batching are

* Insert of objects. This is not enabled when objects being inserted are using _identity_ value generation strategy
* Delete of objects
* Insert of container elements/keys/values
* Delete of container elements/keys/values

*Please note that if using MySQL, you should also specify the connection URL with the argument _rewriteBatchedStatements=true_ since MySQL won't actually batch without this*
