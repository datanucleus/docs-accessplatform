DataNucleus supports persistence to *embedded* Neo4j graph datastores using the https://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-neo4j[datanucleus-neo4j] plugin, which utilises the Neo4j Java driver. 
Simply specify your "connectionURL" as follows

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=neo4j:{db_location}
-----

For example

-----
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=neo4j:myNeo4jDB
-----

You need to have the _org.neo4j_ `neo4j.jar` in the CLASSPATH.

*Note that this is for embedded Neo4j. This is because at the time of writing there is no binary protocol for connecting Java clients to the 
server with Neo4j. When that is available we would hope to support it.*


Things to bear in mind with Neo4j usage :-

* Creation of a PMF/EMF will create a `org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService` and this is shared by all PM/EM instances.
Since this is for an embedded graph datastore then this is the only logical way to provide this. 
Should this plugin be updated to connect to a Neo4J server then this will change.
* Querying can be performed using JDOQL or JPQL. Some components of a filter are handled in the datastore, and the remainder in-memory. 
Currently any expression of a field (in the same 'table'), or a literal are handled in-datastore, as are the operators &amp;&amp;, ||, >, >=, <, <=, ==, and !=. Also
the majority of ordering and result clauses are evaluatable in the datastore, as well as query result range restrictions.
* When an object is persisted it becomes a Node in Neo4j. You define the names of the properties of that node by specifying the "column" name using JDO/JPA metadata
* Any 1-1, 1-N, M-N, N-1 relation is persisted as a Relationship object in Neo4j and any positioning of  elements in a List or array is preserved via a property on the Relationship.
* If you wanted to specify some neo4j.properties file for use of your embedded database then specify the persistence property *datanucleus.ConnectionPropertiesFile* set to the filename.



== Persistence Implementation

Let's take some example classes, and then describe how these are persisted in Neo4j.

[source,java]
-----
public class Store
{
    @Persistent(primaryKey="true", valueStrategy="identity")
    long id;

    Inventory inventory;

    ...
}

public class Inventory
{
    @Persistent(primaryKey="true", valueStrategy="identity")
    long id;

    Set<Product> products;

    ...
}

public class Product
{
    @Persistent(primaryKey="true", valueStrategy="identity")
    long id;

    String name;

    double value;

    ...
}
-----

When we persist a Store object, which has an Inventory, which has three Product objects, then we get the following


* *Node* for the _Store_, with the "id" is represented as the node id
* *Node* for the _Inventory_, with the "id" is represented as the node id
* *Relationship* between the _Store_ Node and the _Inventory_ Node, with the relationship type as "SINGLE_VALUED", and with the property _DN_FIELD_NAME_ as "inventory"
* *Node* for _Product_ #1, with properties for "name" and "value" as well as the "id" represented as the node id
* *Node* for _Product_ #2, with properties for "name" and "value" as well as the "id" represented as the node id
* *Node* for _Product_ #3, with properties for "name" and "value" as well as the "id" represented as the node id
* *Relationship* between the _Inventory_ Node and the _Product_ #1 Node, with the relationship type "MULTI_VALUED" and the property _DN_FIELD_NAME_ as "products"
* *Relationship* between the _Inventory_ Node and the _Product_ #2 Node, with the relationship type "MULTI_VALUED" and the property _DN_FIELD_NAME_ as "products"
* *Relationship* between the _Inventory_ Node and the _Product_ #3 Node, with the relationship type "MULTI_VALUED" and the property _DN_FIELD_NAME_ as "products"
* *Index* in "DN_TYPES" for the _Store_ Node with "class" as "mydomain.Store"
* *Index* in "DN_TYPES" for the _Inventory_ Node with "class" as "mydomain.Inventory"
* *Index* in "DN_TYPES" for the _Product_ Node with "class" as "mydomain.Product"

Note that, to be able to handle polymorphism more easily, if we also have a class _Book_
that extends _Product_ then when we persist an object of this type we will have two entries
in "DN_TYPES" for this Node, one with "class" as "mydomain.Book" and one with "class" as
"mydomain.Product" so we can interrogate the Index to find the real inheritance level of this Node.



== Query Implementation

In terms of querying, a JDOQL/JPQL query is converted into a generic query compilation, and then this is attempted to be converted into a Neo4j "Cypher" query. 
Not all syntaxis are convertable currently and the query falls back to in-memory evauation in that case.
