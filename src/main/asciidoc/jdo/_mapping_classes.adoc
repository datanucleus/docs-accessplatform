We have the following types of classes in DataNucleus JDO.

* link:#persistence_capable[PersistenceCapable] - persistable class with full control over its persistence.
* link:#persistence_aware[PersistenceAware] - a class that is not itself persisted, but that needs to access internals of persistable classes. 

JDO imposes very little on classes used within the persistence process so, to a very large degree, you should design your classes as you would normally do
and not design them to fit JDO.

NOTE: In strict JDO all persistable classes need to have a _default constructor_. With DataNucleus JDO this is not necessary, since all classes are enhanced before persistence and
the enhancer adds on a default constructor if one is not defined.

NOTE: If defining a method _toString_ in a JDO persistable class, be aware that use of a persistable field will cause the load of that field if the object is managed and is not yet loaded.

NOTE: If a JDO persistable class is an element of a Java collection in another entity, you are advised to define _hashCode_ and _equals_ methods for reliable handling by Java collections.



[[persistence_capable]]
== Persistence Capable Classes

The first thing to decide when implementing your persistence layer is which classes are to be persisted.
Let's take a sample class (_Hotel_) as an example. We can define a class as persistable using either annotations in the class, or XML metadata. To achieve the above aim we do this

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable
public class Hotel
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="Hotel">
    ...
</class>
-----

See also :-

* link:metadata_xml.html#class[MetaData reference for <class> element]
* link:annotations.html#PersistenceCapable[Annotations reference for @PersistenceCapable]

NOTE: If any of your other classes *access the fields of these persistable classes directly* then these other classes should be defined as _PersistenceAware_.



[[persistence_aware]]
== Persistence-Aware Classes

If a class is not itself persistable but it interacts with _fields_ of persistable classes then it should be marked as _Persistence Aware_.
You do this as follows

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceAware
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="MyClass" persistence-modifier="persistence-aware">
    ...
</class>
-----

See also :-

* link:annotations.html#PersistenceAware[Annotations reference for @PersistenceAware]


[[read_only]]
== Read-Only Classes

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

You can, if you wish, make a class "read-only". This is a DataNucleus extension and you set it as follows

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.annotations.ReadOnly;

@PersistenceCapable
@ReadOnly
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML Metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="MyClass">
    ...
    <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="read-only" value="true"/>
</class>
-----

In practical terms this means that at runtime, if you try to persist an object of this type then an exception will be thrown. You can read objects of this type from the datastore
just as you would for any persistable class

* link:annotations.html#ReadOnly_Class[Annotations reference for @ReadOnly]



[[detachable]]
== Detachable Classes

One of the main things you need to decide for you persistable classes is whether you will be detaching them from the persistence process for use in a different layer
of your application. If you do want to do this then you need to mark them as _detachable_, like this

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable(detachable="true")
public class Hotel
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="Hotel" detachable="true">
    ...
</class>
-----



[[softdelete]]
== SoftDelete

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, MongoDB, HBase, Cassandra, Neo4j

With standard JDO when you delete an object from persistence it is deleted from the datastore.
DataNucleus provides a useful ability to _soft delete_ objects from persistence. 
In simple terms, any persistable types marked for soft deletion handling will have an extra column added to their datastore table to represent whether the record is soft-deleted. 
If it is soft deleted then it will not be visible at runtime thereafter, but will be present in the datastore.

You mark a persistable type for soft deletion handling like this, optionally specifying the column details

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.annotations.SoftDelete;

@PersistenceCapable
@SoftDelete(columns={@Column(name="DELETE_FLAG")})
public class Hotel
{
    ...
}
-----

If you instead wanted to define this in XML then do it like this

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="Hotel">
    <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="softdelete" value="true"/>
    <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="softdelete-column-name" value="DELETE_FLAG"/>
    ...
</class>
-----


Whenever any objects of type `Hotel` are deleted, like this

[source,java]
-----
pm.deletePersistent(myHotel);
-----

the _myHotel_ object will be updated to set the _soft-delete_ flag to _true_. 

Any call to _pm.getObjectById_ or query will not return the object since it is effectively deleted (though still present in the datastore).

If you want to view the object, you can specify the query extension *datanucleus.query.includeSoftDeletes* as _true_ and the soft-deleted records will be visible.

*This feature is still undergoing development, so not all aspects are feature complete*.
