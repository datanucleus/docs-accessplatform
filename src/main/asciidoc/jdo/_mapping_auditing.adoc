NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

With standard JDO you have no annotations available to automatically add timestamps and user names into the datastore against each record when it is persisted or updated. 
Whilst you can do this manually, setting the field(s) in _prePersist_ callbacks etc, DataNucleus provides some simple annotations to make it simpler still.

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.annotations.CreateTimestamp;
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.annotations.CreateUser;
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.annotations.UpdateTimestamp;
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.annotations.UpdateUser;

@PersistenceCapable
public class Hotel
{
    @CreateTimestamp
    Timestamp createTimestamp;

    @CreateUser
    String createUser;

    @UpdateTimestamp
    Timestamp updateTimestamp;

    @UpdateUser
    String updateUser;

    ...
}
-----

In the above example we have 2 fields in the class that will have columns in the datastore. 
The field _createTimestamp_ and _createUser_ will be persisted at INSERT with the Timestamp and current user for the insert. 
The field _updateTimestamp_ and _updateUser_ will be persisted whenever any update is made to the object in the datastore, with the Timestamp and current user for the update.

If you instead wanted to define this in XML then do it like this

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="Hotel">
    <field name="createTimestamp">
        <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="create-timestamp" value="true"/>
    </field>
    <field name="createUser">
        <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="create-user" value="true"/>
    </field>
    <field name="updateTimestamp">
        <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="update-timestamp" value="true"/>
    </field>
    <field name="updateUser">
        <extension vendor-name="datanucleus" key="update-user" value="true"/>
    </field>
</class>
-----

NOTE: Any field marked as `@CreateTimestamp` / `@UpdateTimestamp` needs to be of type _java.sql.Timestamp_ or _java.time.Instant_.



== Defining the Current User

The timestamp can be automatically generated for population here, but clearly the _current user_ is not available as a standard, and so we have to provide a mechanism for setting it.
You have 2 ways to do this; choose the one that is most appropriate to your situation

* Specify the persistence property *datanucleus.CurrentUser* on the PMF to be the current user to use. Optionally you can also specify the same persistence property on each PM
if you have a particular user for each PM.
* Define an implementation of the DataNucleus interface _org.datanucleus.store.schema.CurrentUserProvider_, and specify it on PMF creation using the property *datanucleus.CurrentUserProvider*.
This is defined as follows

[source,java]
-----
public interface CurrentUserProvider
{
    /** Return the current user. */
    String currentUser();
}
-----

So you could, for example, store the current user in a thread-local and return it via your implementation of this interface.


== Full Traceability Auditing

DataNucleus doesn't currently provide a full traceability auditing capability, whereby you can track all changes to every relevant field. 
This would involve having a mirror table for each persistable class and, for each insert/update of an object, would require 2 SQL statements to be issued.
The obvious consequence would be to slow down the persistence process.

Should your organisation require this, we could work with you to provide it. Please contact us if interested.
