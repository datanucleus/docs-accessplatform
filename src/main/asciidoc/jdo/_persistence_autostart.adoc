By default with JDO implementations when you open a _PersistenceManagerFactory_ and obtain a _PersistenceManager_ 
DataNucleus knows nothing about which classes are to be persisted to that datastore (unless you created the PMF using a persistence-unit). 
JDO implementations only load the Meta-Data for any class when the class is first enlisted in a _PersistenceManager_ operation. 
For example you call _makePersistent_ on an object. The first time a particular class is encountered DataNucleus will dynamically load the Meta-Data for that class. 
This typically works well since in an application in a particular operation the _PersistenceManagerFactory_ may well not encounter all classes that are persistable to that datastore. 
The reason for this dynamic loading is that JDO implementations can't be expected to scan through the whole Java CLASSPATH for classes that could be persisted there. 
That would be inefficient.

There are situations however where it is desirable for DataNucleus to have knowledge about what is to be persisted, or what subclasses of a candidate are 
possible on executing a query, so that it can load the Meta-Data at initialisation of the persistence factory and hence when the classes are encountered 
for the first time nothing needs doing. There are several ways of achieving this

* Define your classes/MetaData in a link:persistence.html#persistenceunit[Persistence Unit] and when the _PersistenceManagerFactory_ is initialised it loads the persistence
unit, and hence the MetaData for the defined classes and mapping files. *This is standardised, and hence is the recommended way.*
* Put a `package.jdo` at the root of the CLASSPATH, containing all classes, and when the first class is encountered it searches for its metadata, 
encounters and parses the root `package.jdo`, and consequently loads the metadata for all classes mentioned in that file.
* Use a DataNucleus extension known as *Auto-Start Mechanism*. This is set with the persistence property *datanucleus.autoStartMechanism*. 
This can be set to _None_, _XML_, _Classes_, _MetaData_. In addition we have _SchemaTable_ for RDBMS datastores. These are described below.



== AutoStartMechanism : None

With this property set to "None" DataNucleus will have no knowledge about classes that are to be persisted into that datastore 
and so will add the classes when the user utilises them in calls to the various _PersistenceManager_ methods.



== AutoStartMechanism : XML

With _XML_, DataNucleus stores the information for starting up DataNucleus in an XML file. 
This is, by default, located in `datanucleusAutoStart.xml` in the current working directory. The file name can be configured using the 
persistence property *datanucleus.autoStartMechanismXmlFile*.
The file is read at startup and DataNucleus loads the classes using this information.

If the user changes their persistence definition a problem can occur when starting up DataNucleus. 
DataNucleus loads up its existing data from the XML configuration file and finds that a table/class required by the this file data no longer exists. 
There are 3 options for what DataNucleus will do in this situation. 
The property *datanucleus.autoStartMechanismMode* defines the behaviour of DataNucleus for this situation. 

* *Checked* will mean that DataNucleus will throw an exception and the user will be expected to manually fix their database mismatch (perhaps by removing the existing tables).
* *Quiet* (the default) will simply remove the entry from the XML file and continue without exception.
* *Ignored* will simply continue without doing anything.


See the DTD at https://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-core/blob/master/src/main/resources/org/datanucleus/store/autostart/datanucleus_autostart_1_0.dtd[this link].
A sample file would look something like

[source,xml]
-----
<datanucleus_autostart>
    <class name="mydomain.MyClass" table="MY_TABLE_1" type="FCO" version="3.1.1"/>
</datanucleus_autostart>
-----


== AutoStartMechanism : Classes

With _Classes_, the user provides to the persistence factory the list of classes to use as the initial list of classes to be persisted. 
They specify this via the persistence property *datanucleus.autoStartClassNames*, specifying the list of classes as comma-separated. 
This gives DataNucleus a head start meaning that it will not need to "discover" these classes later.


== AutoStartMechanism : MetaData

With _MetaData_, the user provides to the persistence factory the list of metadata files to use as the initial list of classes to be persisted. 
They specify this via the persistence property *datanucleus.autoStartMetaDataFiles*, specifying the list of metadata files as comma-separated. 
This gives DataNucleus a head start meaning that it will not need to "discover" these classes later.


== AutoStartMechanism : SchemaTable (RDBMS only)

*When using an RDBMS datastore* the _SchemaTable_ auto-start mechanism stores the list of classes (and their tables, types and version of DataNucleus) in a datastore table 
*NUCLEUS_TABLES*. This table is read at startup of DataNucleus, and provides DataNucleus with the necessary knowledge it needs to continue persisting these classes. 
This table is continuously updated during a session of a DataNucleus-enabled application.

If the user changes their persistence definition a problem can occur when starting up DataNucleus. 
DataNucleus loads up its existing data from NUCLEUS_TABLES and finds that a table/class required by the NUCLEUS_TABLES data no longer exists.
There are 3 options for what DataNucleus will do in this situation. 
The property *datanucleus.autoStartMechanismMode* defines the behaviour of DataNucleus for this situation. 

* *Checked* will mean that DataNucleus will throw an exception and the user will be expected to manually fix their database mismatch (perhaps by removing the existing tables).
* *Quiet* (the default) will simply remove the entry from NUCLEUS_TABLES and continue without exception.
* *Ignored* will simply continue without doing anything.

The default database schema used the _SchemaTable_ is described below:

-----
TABLE : NUCLEUS_TABLES
(
    COLUMN : CLASS_NAME VARCHAR(128) PRIMARY KEY,  -- Fully qualified persistent Class name
    COLUMN : TABLE_NAME VARCHAR(128),              -- Table name
    COLUMN : TYPE VARCHAR(4),                      -- FCO | SCO
    COLUMN : OWNER VARCHAR(2),                     -- 1 | 0
    COLUMN : VERSION VARCHAR(20),                  -- DataNucleus version
    COLUMN : INTERFACE_NAME VARCHAR(255)           -- Fully qualified persistent Class type 
                                                   -- of the persistent Interface implemented
)

If you want to change the table name (from `NUCLEUS_TABLES`) you can set the persistence property *datanucleus.rdbms.schemaTable.tableName*
