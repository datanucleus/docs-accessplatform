Once you have persisted objects you need to query them. 
For example if you have a web application representing an online store, the user asks to see all products of a particular type, ordered by the price. 
This requires you to query the datastore for these products. JDO specifies support for 

* link:#jdoql[JDOQL] : a string-based query language using Java syntax.
* link:#jdoql_typed[Typed] : following JDOQL syntax but providing an API supporting refactoring of classes and the queries they are used in.
* link:#sql[SQL] : typically only for RDBMS
* link:#jpql[JPQL] : not explicitly part of the JDO spec, but provided by DataNucleus JDO.
* link:#stored_procedures[Stored Procedures] : not explicitly part of the JDO spec, but provided by DataNucleus JDO as an option for RDBMS.

Which query language is used is down to the developer. 
The data-tier of an application could be written by a primarily Java developer, who would typically think in an object-oriented way and so would likely prefer *JDOQL*. 
On the other hand the data-tier could be written by a datastore developer who is more familiar with SQL concepts and so could easily make more use of *SQL*.
This is the power of an implementation like DataNucleus in that it provides the flexibility for different people to develop the data-tier utilising their own skills 
to the full without having to learn totally new concepts.

TIP: We recommend using JDOQL for queries wherever possible since it is object-based and datastore agnostic, giving you extra flexibility in the future. 
If not possible using JDOQL, only then use a language appropriate to the datastore in question

NOTE: For some datastores additional query languages may be available specific to that datastore - please check the link:../datastores/datastores.html[datastores documentation].



There are 2 categories of queries with JDO :-

* link:query.html#api[*Programmatic Query*] where the query is defined using the JDO Query API.
* link:query.html#named[*Named Query*] where the query is defined in MetaData and referred to by its name at runtime.
