NOTE: Support for BeanValidation includes all versions of that API (1.0, 1.1, 2.0).

The http://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation API (JSR0303/JSR0349/JSR0380)] can be hooked up with JDO (DataNucleus extension) so that you have validation of an objects values 
prior to persistence, update and deletion. To do this

* Put the *javax.validation* `validation-api` jar in your CLASSPATH, along with the Bean Validation implementation jar of your choice (e.g Apache BVal)
* Set the persistence property *datanucleus.validation.mode* to one of _auto_ (default), _none_, or _callback_
* Optionally set the persistence property(s) *datanucleus.validation.group.pre-persist*, *datanucleus.validation.group.pre-update*,
*datanucleus.validation.group.pre-remove* to fine tune the behaviour (the default is to run validation on pre-persist and pre-update if you don't specify these).
* Use JDO as you normally would for persisting objects

To give a simple example of what you can do with the Bean Validation API

[source,java]
-----
@PersistenceCapable
public class Person 
{
    @PrimaryKey
    @NotNull
    private Long id;

    @NotNull
    @Size(min = 3, max = 80)
    private String name;

    ...
}
-----

So we are validating that instances of the _Person_ class will have an "id" that is not null and that the "name" field is not null and between 3 and 80 characters. 
If it doesn't validate then at persist/update an exception will be thrown.
You can add bean validation annotations to classes marked as `@PersistenceCapable`.

A further use of the Bean Validation annotations `@Size(max=...)` and `@NotNull` is that if you specify these then you have no need to specify the equivalent JDO "length" and "allowsNull"
since they equate to the same thing.
