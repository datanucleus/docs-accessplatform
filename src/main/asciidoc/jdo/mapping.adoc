To implement a persistence layer with JDO you firstly need to map the classes and fields/properties that are involved in the persistence process to how they are represented in the datastore.
This can be as simple as marking the classes as `@PersistenceCapable` and defaulting the datastore definition, or you can configure down to the fine detail of precisely what schema it maps on to.
The following sections deal with the many options available for using metadata to map your persistable classes.


When mapping a class for JDO you make use of _metadata_, and this _metadata_ can be Java annotations, or can be XML metadata, or a mixture of both,
or you could even define it using link:metadata_api.html[a dynamic API]. This is very much down to your own personal preference but we try to present both ways here.

TIP: We advise trying to keep schema information out of annotations, so that you avoid tying compiled code to a specific datastore. That way you
retain datastore-independence. This may not be a concern for your project however.

NOTE: Whilst the JDO spec provides for you to specify your mapping information using JDO metadata (link:annotations.html[JDO annotations], 
or link:metadata_xml.html[JDO/ORM XML Metadata], or via the link:metadata_api.html[Metadata API]), 
it also allows you the option of using JPA metadata (JPA annotations, `orm.xml`). This is provided as a way of easily migrating across to JDO from JPA, for example. 
Consult the link:../jpa/mapping.html[DataNucleus JPA mappings docs] for details.


In terms of the relative priority of annotations, JDO XML and ORM XML metadata, the following figure highlights the process

image:../images/jdo_metadata.png[]

So you can provide the metadata via link:annotations.html[JDO annotations] solely, 
or via link:annotations.html[JDO annotations] plus link:metadata_xml.html[ORM XML Metadata overrides], 
or via link:metadata_xml.html[JDO XML Metadata] solely, 
or via link:metadata_xml.html[JDO XML Metadata] plus link:metadata_xml.html[ORM XML Metadata overrides], 
or finally via a link:metadata_api.html[Metadata API]. 

If you are using XML overrides for ORM, this definition will be merged in to the base definition (JDO annotations or JDO XML Metadata).
Note that you can utilise JDO annotations for one class, and then JDO XML Metadata for another class should you so wish.

One further alternative is if you have annotations in your classes, you provide JDO XML Metadata (`package.jdo`), and also 
ORM XML Metadata (`package-{mapping}.orm`). In this case the annotations are the base representation, applying overrides from JDO XML Metadata, and then overrides from the ORM XML Metadata.


TIP: When not using the MetaData API we recommend that you use either XML or annotations for the basic persistence information, but always use XML for 
schema information. This is because it is liable to change at deployment time and hence is accessible when in XML form whereas in annotations you add an 
extra compile cycle (and also you may need to deploy to some other datastore at some point, hence needing a different deployment).
