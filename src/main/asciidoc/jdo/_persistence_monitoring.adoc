DataNucleus allows a user to enable various MBeans internally. These can then be used for monitoring the number of datastore calls etc.


== Via API

The simplest way to monitor DataNucleus is to use its API for monitoring. 
Internally there are several MBeans (as used by JMX) and you can navigate to these to get the required information. 
To enable this set the persistence property *datanucleus.enableStatistics* to _true_. 
There are then two sets of statistics; one for the PMF and one for each PM. You access these as follows

[source,java]
-----
JDOPersistenceManagerFactory dnPMF = (JDOPersistenceManagerFactory)pmf;
FactoryStatistics stats = dnPMF.getNucleusContext().getStatistics();
... (access the statistics information)


JDOPersistenceManager dnPM = (JDOPersistenceManager)pm;
ManagerStatistics stats = dnPM.getExecutionContext().getStatistics();
... (access the statistics information)
-----


== Using JMX
                
The MBeans used by DataNucleus can be accessed via JMX at runtime. More about JMX http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html[here].

An MBean server is bundled with the JRE since v1.5, and you can easily activate DataNucleus MBeans registration by creating your PMF 
with the persistence property *datanucleus.jmxType* as _default_

Additionally, setting a few system properties are necessary for configuring the Sun JMX implementation. The minimum properties required are the following:

* com.sun.management.jmxremote
* com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate
* com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl
* com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=<port number>

Usage example:

-----
java -cp TheClassPathInHere
     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8001

Once you start your application and DataNucleus is initialized you can browse DataNucleus MBeans using a tool called jconsole (jconsole is distributed with the Sun JDK) via the URL:

-----
service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://hostName:portNum/jmxrmi
-----
                
Note that the mode of usage is presented in this document as matter of example, and by no means we recommend to disable authentication and secured communication channels. 
Further details on the Sun JMX implementation and how to configure it properly can be found http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html[here].

DataNucleus MBeans are registered in a MBean Server when DataNucleus is started up (e.g. upon JDO PMF instantiation). 
To see the full list of DataNucleus MBeans, refer to the http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/core/latest/org/datanucleus/management/runtime/package-summary.html[javadocs].

To enable management using MX4J you must specify the persistence property *datanucleus.jmxType* as _mx4j_ when creating the PMF, and have the `mx4j` and `mx4j-tools` jars in the CLASSPATH.
