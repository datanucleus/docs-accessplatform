Any JDO-enabled application will require at least one _PersistenceManagerFactory_ (PMF)
http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.jdo/3.2/javax/jdo/PersistenceManagerFactory.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[]]. 
Typically applications create one per datastore being utilised. 
A _PersistenceManagerFactory_ provides access to _PersistenceManager(s)_ which allow objects to be persisted, and retrieved.
The _PersistenceManagerFactory_ can be configured to provide particular behaviour.

CAUTION: A _PersistenceManagerFactory_ is designed to be thread-safe. A _PersistenceManager_ is not.

TIP: A _PersistenceyManagerFactory_ is expensive to create so you should create one per datastore for your application and retain it for as long as it is needed.
Always close your _PersistenceManagerFactory_ after you have finished with it.


There are many ways of creating a _PersistenceManagerFactory_, some of which are shown below

[source,java]
-----
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty("javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass", "org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactory");
properties.setProperty("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL","jdbc:mysql://localhost/myDB");
properties.setProperty("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName","login");
properties.setProperty("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword","password");

PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory(properties);
-----

A slight variation on this, is to have a file to specify these properties in a file

-----
javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass=org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactory
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql://localhost/myDB
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName=login
javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword=password
-----

and then to create the _PersistenceManagerFactory_ using this file

[source,java]
-----
File propsFile = new File(filename);
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory(propsFile);
-----

or if the above file is in the CLASSPATH (at `datanucleus.properties` in the root of the CLASSPATH), then

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory("datanucleus.properties");
-----

If using a _named PMF_ file, you can create the PMF by providing the link:#pmf_named[name of the PMF] like this

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory("myNamedPMF");
-----

If using a `META-INF/persistence.xml` file, you can simply specify the link:#persistenceunit[persistence-unit] name as

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory("myPersistenceUnit");
-----

Another alternative, when specifying your datastore via JNDI, would be to call _JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory(jndiLocation, context);_, 
and then set the other persistence properties on the received PMF.

Whichever way we wish to obtain the _PersistenceManagerFactory_ we have defined a series of properties to give the behaviour of the _PersistenceManagerFactory_. 
The first property specifies to use the DataNucleus implementation, and the following 4 properties define the datastore that it should connect to. 
There are many properties available. Some of these are standard JDO properties, and some are DataNucleus extensions.



[[persistenceunit]]
== PersistenceManagerFactory for Persistence-Unit

When designing an application you can usually nicely separate your persistable objects into independent groupings that can be treated separately, 
perhaps within a different DAO object, if using DAOs. JDO uses the (JPA) idea of a _persistence-unit_. 
A _persistence-unit_ provides a convenient way of specifying a set of metadata files, and classes, and jars that contain all classes to be persisted in a grouping. 
The persistence-unit is named, and the name is used for identifying it.
Consequently this name can then be used when defining what classes are to be enhanced, for example.

To define a _persistence-unit_ you first need to add a file `persistence.xml` to the `META-INF/` directory of the CLASSPATH (this may mean `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF` when using a 
web-application in such as Tomcat). This file will be used to define your _persistence-unit(s)_. Lets show an example

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<persistence xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd" version="2.1">

    <!-- Online Store -->
    <persistence-unit name="OnlineStore">
        <class>mydomain.samples.metadata.store.Product</class>
        <class>mydomain.samples.metadata.store.Book</class>
        <class>mydomain.samples.metadata.store.CompactDisc</class>
        <class>mydomain.samples.metadata.store.Customer</class>
        <class>mydomain.samples.metadata.store.Supplier</class>
        <exclude-unlisted-classes/>
        <properties>
            <property name="datanucleus.ConnectionURL" value="jdbc:h2:mem:datanucleus"/>
            <property name="datanucleus.ConnectionUserName" value="sa"/>
            <property name="datanucleus.ConnectionPassword" value=""/>
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>

    <!-- Accounting -->
    <persistence-unit name="Accounting">
        <mapping-file>/mydomain/samples/metadata/accounts/package.jdo</mapping-file>
        <properties>
            <property name="datanucleus.ConnectionURL" value="jdbc:h2:mem:datanucleus"/>
            <property name="datanucleus.ConnectionUserName" value="sa"/>
            <property name="datanucleus.ConnectionPassword" value=""/>
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>

</persistence>
-----

In this example we have defined 2 _persistence-unit(s)_. 
The first has the name "OnlineStore" and contains 5 classes (annotated). 
The second has the name "Accounting" and contains a metadata file called `package.jdo` in a particular package (which will define the classes being part of that unit). 
This means that once we have defined this we can reference these _persistence-unit(s)_ in our persistence operations. 
You can find the XSD for `persistence.xml` http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd[here].

There are several sub-elements of this `persistence.xml` file

* *provider* - Not used by JDO
* *jta-data-source* - JNDI name for JTA connections (make sure you set _transaction-type_ as *JTA* on the persistence-unit for this).
You can alternatively specify JDO standard *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionFactoryName* to the same end.
* *non-jta-data-source* - JNDI name for non-JTA connections.
You can alternatively specify JDO standard *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionFactory2Name* to the same end.
* *shared-cache-mode* - Defines the way the L2 cache will operate. ALL means all entities cached. NONE means no entities will be cached. ENABLE_SELECTIVE means only cache
the entities that are specified. DISABLE_SELECTIVE means cache all unless specified. UNSPECIFIED leaves it to DataNucleus.
* *validation-mode* - Defines the validation mode for Bean Validation. AUTO, CALLBACK or NONE.
* *jar-file* - name of a JAR file to scan for annotated classes to include in this persistence-unit.
* *mapping-file* - name of an XML "mapping" file containing persistence information to be included in this persistence-unit. 
This is the JDO XML Metadata file (_package.jdo_) (*not* the ORM XML Metadata file)
* *class* - name of an annotated class to include in this persistence-unit
* *properties* - properties defining the persistence factory to be used.
* *exclude-unlisted-classes* - when this is specified then it will only load metadata for the classes/mapping files listed.


=== Use with JDO

JDO accepts the "persistence-unit" name to be specified when creating the _PersistenceManagerFactory_, like this

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory("MyPersistenceUnit");
-----

=== Metadata loading using persistence unit

When you specify a PMF using a `persistence.xml` it will load the metadata for all classes that are specified directly in the persistence unit,
as well as all classes defined in JDO XML metadata files that are specified directly in the persistence unit. 
If you don't have the _exclude-unlisted-classes_ set to true then it will also do a CLASSPATH scan to try to find any other *annotated* classes that are part of that persistence unit.
To set the CLASSPATH scanner to a custom version use the persistence property *datanucleus.metadata.scanner* and set it to the classname of the scanner class.


[[persistenceunit_dynamic]]
=== Dynamically generated Persistence-Unit

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus allows an extension to the JDO API to dynamically create persistence-units at runtime.
Use the following code sample as a guide. Obviously any classes defined in the persistence-unit need to have been enhanced.

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.metadata.PersistenceUnitMetaData;
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactory;
 
PersistenceUnitMetaData pumd = new PersistenceUnitMetaData("dynamic-unit", "RESOURCE_LOCAL", null);
pumd.addClassName("mydomain.test.A");
pumd.setExcludeUnlistedClasses();
pumd.addProperty("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL", "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:nucleus");
pumd.addProperty("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName", "sa");
pumd.addProperty("javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword", "");
pumd.addProperty("datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll", "true");

PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = new JDOPersistenceManagerFactory(pumd, null);
-----

It should be noted that if you call _pumd.toString();_ then this returns the text that would have been found in a `persistence.xml` file.



[[pmf_named]]
== Named PersistenceManagerFactory

Typically applications create one PMF per datastore being utilised. An alternate to link:#persistenceunit[persistence-unit] is to use a *named PMF*, defined in a file
`META-INF/jdoconfig.xml` at the root of the CLASSPATH (this may mean `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF` when using a web-application).
Let's see an example of a `jdoconfig.xml`

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<jdoconfig xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/jdoconfig"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/jdoconfig
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/jdoconfig_3_2.xsd" version="3.2">

    <!-- Datastore Txn PMF -->
    <persistence-manager-factory name="Datastore">
        <property name="javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass" value="org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactory"/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost/datanucleus?useServerPrepStmts=false"/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName" value="datanucleus"/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword" value=""/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.Optimistic" value="false"/>
        <property name="datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll" value="true"/>
    </persistence-manager-factory>

    <!-- Optimistic Txn PMF -->
    <persistence-manager-factory name="Optimistic">
        <property name="javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass" value="org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactory"/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost/datanucleus?useServerPrepStmts=false"/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName" value="datanucleus"/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword" value=""/>
        <property name="javax.jdo.option.Optimistic" value="true"/>
        <property name="datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll" value="true"/>
    </persistence-manager-factory>

</jdoconfig>
-----

So in this example we have 2 named PMFs. The first is known by the name "Datastore" and utilises datastore transactions. 
The second is known by the name "Optimistic" and utilises optimistic locking. 
You simply define all properties for the particular PMF within its specification block. And finally we instantiate our PMF like this

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory("Optimistic");
-----

That's it. The PMF we are returned from JDOHelper will have all of the properties defined in `META-INF/jdoconfig.xml` under the name of "Optimistic".


[[pmf_properties]]
== PersistenceManagerFactory Properties

An PersistenceManagerFactory is very configurable, and DataNucleus provides many properties to tailor its behaviour to your persistence needs.


=== Specifying the datastore properties

With JDO you have 3 ways of specifying the datastore via persistence properties

* *Specify the connection URL/userName/password(/driverName)* and it will internally create a DataSource for this URL (with optional connection pooling). 
This is achieved by specifying *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL*, *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName*, *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword*
and optionally *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName*.
* *Specify the JNDI name of the connectionFactory*. This is achieved by specifying *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionFactoryName*, and *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionFactory2Name* (for secondary operations)
* *Specify the DataSource of the connectionFactory*. This is achieved by specifying
*javax.jdo.option.ConnectionFactory*, and *javax.jdo.option.ConnectionFactory2* (for secondary operations)

The JNDI routes are typically only for use with RDBMS datastores.

NOTE: The "ConnectionURL" value for the different supported datastores is defined in the link:../datastores/datastores.html[Datastore Guide]

|datanucleus.detachmentFields
|When detaching you can control what happens to loaded/unloaded fields of the FetchPlan. 
The default for JDO is to load any unloaded fields of the current FetchPlan before detaching. 
You can also unload any loaded fields that are not in the current FetchPlan (so you only get the fields you require) as well as a combination of both options
{*load-fields*, unload-fields, load-unload-fields}

|datanucleus.maxFetchDepth
|Specifies the default maximum fetch depth to use for fetching operations.
The JDO spec defines a default of 1, meaning that only the first level of related objects will be fetched by default.
{-1, *1*, positive integer (non-zero)}

|datanucleus.detachedState
|Allows control over which mechanism to use to determine the fields to be detached.
By default DataNucleus uses the defined "fetch-groups". 
JPA doesn't have that (although it is an option with DataNucleus), so we also allow _loaded_ which will detach just the currently loaded fields, and _all_ which will
detach all fields of the object. Be careful with this option since it, when used with maxFetchDepth of -1 will detach a whole object graph!
{*fetch-groups*, all, loaded}

|datanucleus.ServerTimeZoneID
|Id of the TimeZone under which the datastore server is running. If this is not specified or is set to null it is assumed that the 
datastore server is running in the same timezone as the JVM under which DataNucleus is running.

|datanucleus.PersistenceUnitName
|Name of a _persistence-unit_ to be found in a `persistence.xml` file (under META-INF) that defines the persistence properties to use
and the classes to use within the persistence process.

|datanucleus.PersistenceUnitLoadClasses
|Used when we have specified the persistence-unit name for a PMF and where we want the datastore "tables" for all classes of that persistence-unit 
loading up into the StoreManager. Defaults to false since some databases are slow so such an operation would slow down the startup process.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.persistenceXmlFilename
|URL name of the `persistence.xml` file that should be used instead of using `META-INF/persistence.xml`.

|datanucleus.datastoreReadTimeout
|The timeout to apply to all reads (millisecs), e.g by query or by PM.getObjectById(). *Only applies if the underlying datastore supports it*
{*0*, A positive value (MILLISECONDS)}

|datanucleus.datastoreWriteTimeout
|The timeout to apply to all writes (millisecs), e.g by makePersistent, or by an update. *Only applies if the underlying datastore supports it*
{*0*, A positive value (MILLISECONDS)}

|datanucleus.singletonPMFForName
|Whether to only allow a singleton PMF for a particular name (the name can be either the name of the PMF in `jdoconfig.xml`, or the name of the persistence-unit).
If a subsequent request is made for a PMF with a name that already exists then a warning will be logged and the original PMF returned.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.allowListenerUpdateAfterInit
|Whether you want to be able to add/remove listeners on the JDO PMF after it is marked as not configurable (when the first PM is created). 
The default matches the JDO spec, not allowing changes to the listeners in use.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.cdi.bean.manager
|Specifies a CDI `BeanManager` object that will be used to allow injection of dependencies into `AttributeConverter` objects.

|datanucleus.jmxType
|Which JMX server to use when hooking into JMX. Please refer to the link:persistence.html#monitoring[Monitoring Guide]
{default, mx4j}

|datanucleus.deletionPolicy
|Allows the user to decide the policy when deleting objects. The default is "JDO2" which firstly checks if the field is dependent and if so deletes dependents, 
and then for others will null any foreign keys out. The problem with this option is that it takes no account of whether the user has also
defined <foreign-key> elements, so we provide a "DataNucleus" mode that does the dependent field part first and then if a FK element is defined 
will leave it to the FK in the datastore to perform any actions, and otherwise does the nulling.
{*JDO2*, DataNucleus}

|datanucleus.identityStringTranslatorType
|You can allow identities input to _pm.getObjectById(id)_ be translated into valid JDO ids if there is a suitable translator.
See link:../extensions/extensions.html#identitystringtranslator[Identity String Translator image:../images/nucleus_extensionpoint.png[]]

|datanucleus.identityKeyTranslatorType
|You can allow identities input to _pm.getObjectById(cls, key)_ be translated into valid JDO ids if there is a suitable key translator.

|Defines the action if a PM is closed and there is an active transaction present
{*rollback*, exception}

|datanucleus.objectProvider.className
|Class name for the ObjectProvider to use when managing object state. The default for RDBMS is ReferentialStateManagerImpl, and is StateManagerImpl for all other datastores.

|datanucleus.type.wrapper.basis
|Whether to use the "instantiated" type of a field, or the "declared" type of a field to determine which wrapper to use when the field is SCO mutable.
{*instantiated*, declared}

|datanucleus.useImplementationCreator
|Whether to allow use of the implementation-creator (feature of JDO to dynamically create implementations of persistent interfaces). 
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.manageRelationships
|This allows the user control over whether DataNucleus will try to manage bidirectional relations, correcting the input objects so that all relations are consistent.
This process runs when flush()/commit() is called. You can set it to _false_ if you always set both sides of a relation when persisting/updating.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.manageRelationshipsChecks
|This allows the user control over whether DataNucleus will make consistency checks on bidirectional relations. 
If "datanucleus.managedRelationships" is not selected then no checks are performed. 
If a consistency check fails at flush()/commit() then a JDOUserException is thrown.
You can set it to _false_ if you want to omit all consistency checks.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.persistenceByReachabilityAtCommit
|Whether to run the "persistence-by-reachability" algorithm at commit() time.
This means that objects that were reachable at a call to makePersistent() but that are no longer persistent will be removed from persistence.
For performance improvements, consider turning this off.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.classLoaderResolverName
|Name of a ClassLoaderResolver to use in class loading. DataNucleus provides a default that loosely follows the JDO specification for class loading. 
This property allows the user to override this with their own class better suited to their own loading requirements.
{*datanucleus*, {name of class-loader-resolver plugin}}

|datanucleus.primaryClassLoader
|Sets a primary classloader for situations where a primary classloader is not accessible. 
This ClassLoader is used when the class is not found in the default ClassLoader search path. 
As example, when the database driver is loaded by a different ClassLoader not in the ClassLoader search path for JDO specification.

|datanucleus.plugin.pluginRegistryClassName
|Name of a class that acts as registry for plug-ins.
This defaults to _org.datanucleus.plugin.NonManagedPluginRegistry_ (for when not using OSGi).
If you are within an OSGi environment you can set this to _org.datanucleus.plugin.OSGiPluginRegistry_

|datanucleus.plugin.pluginRegistryBundleCheck
|Defines what happens when plugin bundles are found and are duplicated
{*EXCEPTION*, LOG, NONE}

|datanucleus.plugin.allowUserBundles
|Defines whether user-provided bundles providing DataNucleus extensions will be registered. This is only respected if used in a non-Eclipse OSGi environment.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.plugin.validatePlugins
|Defines whether a validation step should be performed checking for plugin dependencies etc. This is only respected if used in a non-Eclipse OSGi environment.
{*false*, true}

|datanucleus.findObject.validateWhenCached
|When a user calls getObjectById (JDO) and they request validation this allows the turning off of validation when an object is found in the (L2) cache.
Can be useful for performance reasons, but should be used with care.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.findObject.typeConversion
|When calling PM.getObjectById(Class, Object) the second argument really ought to be the exact type of the primary-key field. 
This property enables conversion of basic numeric types (Long, Integer, Short) to the appropriate numeric type (if the PK is a numeric type). 
{*true*, false}

{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.SerializeRead
|With datastore transactions you can apply locking to objects as they are read from the datastore.

[[emf_props_dn_query]]
=== DataNucleus Query Properties

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus provides the following properties for configuring query handling used by the PersistenceManagerFactory.

[cols="2,6", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description + Values

|datanucleus.query.flushBeforeExecution
|This property can enforce a flush to the datastore of any outstanding changes just before executing all queries. 
If using optimistic locking any updates are typically held back until flush/commit and so the query would otherwise not take them into account.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.query.closeable
|When set to false (the default) will simply close all results when close() is called.
When set to true it will also close the query object making it unusable, releasing all resources as well. Also applies to a JDO Extent use of close().
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.query.useFetchPlan
|Whether to use the FetchPlan when executing a JDOQL query.
The default is to use it which means that the relevant fields of the object will be retrieved. This allows the option of just retrieving the identity columns.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.query.compileOptimiseVarThis
|This optimisation will detect and try to fix a query clause like "var == this" (which is pointless). It is not very advanced but may help in some situations
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.query.jdoql.allowAll
|javax.jdo.query.JDOQL queries are allowed by JDO only to run SELECT queries.
This extension permits to bypass this limitation so that DataNucleus extension bulk "update" and bulk "delete" can be run.
{*false*, true}

|datanucleus.query.sql.allowAll
|javax.jdo.query.SQL queries are allowed by JDO only to run SELECT queries. This extension permits to bypass this limitation (so for example can execute stored procedures).
{*false*, true}

|datanucleus.query.jpql.allowRange
|JPQL queries, by the JPA spec, do not allow specification of the range in the query string.
This extension to allow "RANGE x,y" after the ORDER BY clause of JPQL string queries.
{*false*, true}

|datanucleus.query.checkUnusedParameters
|Whether to check for unused input parameters and throw an exception if found.
The JDO spec requires this check and is a good guide to having misnamed a parameter name in the query for example.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.sql.syntaxChecks
|Whether to perform some basic syntax checking on SQL/"native" queries that they include PK, version and discriminator columns where necessary.
{*true*, false}
|===



[[pmf_props_specific_query]]
=== DataNucleus Datastore-Specific Properties

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus provides the following properties for configuring datastore-specific used by the PersistenceManagerFactory.

[cols="2,6", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description + Values

|datanucleus.rdbms.datastoreAdapterClassName
|This property allows you to supply the class name of the adapter to use for your datastore.
The default is not to specify this property and DataNucleus will autodetect the datastore type and use its own internal datastore adapter classes. 
This allows you to override the default behaviour where there maybe is some issue with the default adapter class.

|datanucleus.rdbms.useLegacyNativeValueStrategy
|This property changes the process for deciding the value strategy to use when the user has selected "native" to be like it was with DN version 3.0 and earlier, so using
"increment" and "uuid-hex".
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.rdbms.statementBatchLimit
|Maximum number of statements that can be batched. The default is 50 and also applies to delete of objects.
Please refer to the link:../datastores/datastores.html#statement_batching[Statement Batching guide]
{integer value (0 = no batching)}

|datanucleus.rdbms.checkExistTablesOrViews
|Whether to check if the table/view exists. If false, it disables the automatic generation of tables that don't exist.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.rdbms.useDefaultSqlType
|This property applies for schema generation in terms of setting the default column "sql-type" (when you haven't defined it) and where
the JDBC driver has multiple possible "sql-type" for a "jdbc-type".
If the property is set to false, it will take the first provided "sql-type" from the JDBC driver.
If the property is set to true, it will take the "sql-type" that matches what the DataNucleus "plugin.xml" implies.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.rdbms.initializeColumnInfo
|Allows control over what column information is initialised when a table is loaded for the first time. 
By default info for all columns will be loaded. Unfortunately some RDBMS are particularly poor at returning this information so we allow reduced forms to just load the 
primary key column info, or not to load any.
{*ALL*, PK, NONE}

|datanucleus.rdbms.classAdditionMaxRetries
|The maximum number of retries when trying to find a class to persist or when validating a class.
{*3*, A positive integer}

|datanucleus.rdbms.constraintCreateMode
|How to determine the RDBMS constraints to be created. 
*DataNucleus* will automatically add foreign-keys/indices to handle all relationships, and will utilise the specified MetaData foreign-key information.
*JDO2* will only use the information in the MetaData file(s).
{*DataNucleus*, JDO2}

|datanucleus.rdbms.uniqueConstraints.mapInverse
|Whether to add unique constraints to the element table for a map inverse field.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.rdbms.discriminatorPerSubclassTable
|Property that controls if only the base class where the discriminator is defined will have a discriminator column
{*false*, true}

|datanucleus.rdbms.stringDefaultLength
|The default (max) length to use for all strings that don't have their column length defined in MetaData.
{*255*, A valid length}

|datanucleus.rdbms.stringLengthExceededAction
|Defines what happens when persisting a String field and its length exceeds the length of the underlying datastore column. The default is to throw an Exception. 
The other option is to truncate the String to the length of the datastore column.
{*EXCEPTION*, TRUNCATE}

|datanucleus.rdbms.useColumnDefaultWhenNull
|If an object is being persisted and a field (column) is null, the default behaviour is to look whether the column has a "default" value defined in the datastore and pass that in. 
You can turn this off and instead pass in NULL for the column by setting this property to _false_.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.rdbms.persistEmptyStringAsNull
|When persisting an empty string, should it be persisted as null in the datastore?
This is to allow for datastores such as Oracle that dont differentiate between null and empty string. 
If it is set to false and the datastore doesnt differentiate then a special character will be saved when storing an empty string (and interpreted when reading in).
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.rdbms.query.fetchDirection
|The direction in which the query results will be navigated.
{*forward*, reverse, unknown}

|datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetType
|Type of ResultSet to create. Note 1) Not all JDBC drivers accept all options. The values correspond directly to the ResultSet options. 
Note 2) Not all java.util.List operations are available for scrolling result sets. An Exception is raised when unsupported operations are invoked.
{*forward-only*, scroll-sensitive, scroll-insensitive}

|datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetConcurrency
|Whether the ResultSet is readonly or can be updated. Not all JDBC drivers support all options.
The values correspond directly to the ResultSet options.
{*read-only*, updateable}

|datanucleus.rdbms.query.multivaluedFetch
|How any multi-valued field should be fetched in a query. 'exists' means use an EXISTS statement hence retrieving all elements for the queried objects in one SQL 
with EXISTS to select the affected owner objects. 'none' means don't fetch container elements.
{*exists*, none}

|datanucleus.rdbms.oracle.nlsSortOrder
|Sort order for *Oracle* String fields in queries (BINARY disables native language sorting).
{*LATIN*, See Oracle documentation}

|datanucleus.rdbms.mysql.engineType
|Specify the default engine for any tables created in *MySQL/MariaDB*.
{*InnoDB*, valid engine for MySQL}

|datanucleus.rdbms.mysql.collation
|Specify the default collation for any tables created in *MySQL/MariaDB*.
{valid collation for MySQL}

|datanucleus.rdbms.mysql.characterSet
|Specify the default charset for any tables created in *MySQL/MariaDB*.
{valid charset for MySQL}

|datanucleus.rdbms.informix.useSerialForIdentity
|Whether we are using SERIAL for identity columns with *Informix* (instead of SERIAL8).
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.rdbms.schemaTable.tableName
|Name of the table to use when using auto-start mechanism of "SchemaTable"
Please refer to the link:persistence.html#autostart[Auto-Start guide]
{NUCLEUS_TABLES, Valid table name}

|datanucleus.rdbms.dynamicSchemaUpdates
|Whether to allow dynamic updates to the schema. This means that upon each insert/update the types of objects will be tested and any previously unknown implementations of
interfaces will be added to the existing schema.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.rdbms.omitDatabaseMetaDataGetColumns
|Whether to bypass all calls to DatabaseMetaData.getColumns(). This JDBC method is called to get schema information, but on some JDBC drivers (e.g Derby) it can
take an inordinate amount of time. Setting this to true means that your datastore schema has to be correct and no checks will be performed.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.rdbms.refreshAllTablesOnRefreshColumns
|Whether to refresh all known tables whenever we need to get schema info for a table from the JDBC driver. Set this to _true_ if you want to refresh all known table's
information in the same call. If your application is changing the schema often then this should likely be _false_.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.rdbms.sqlTableNamingStrategy
|Name of the plugin to use for defining the names of the aliases of tables in SQL statements.
{*alpha-scheme*, t-scheme}

|datanucleus.rdbms.tableColumnOrder
|How we should order the columns in a table. The default is to put the fields of the owning class first, followed by superclasses, then subclasses. 
An alternative is to start from the base superclass first, working down to the owner, then the subclasses
{*owner-first*, superclass-first}

|datanucleus.rdbms.allowColumnReuse
|This property allows you to reuse columns for more than 1 field of a class.
It is _false_ by default to protect the user from erroneously typing in a column name. Additionally, if a column is reused, the user ought to think about
how to determine which field is written to that column ... all reuse ought to imply the same value in those fields so it doesn't matter which field is written there, or
retrieved from there.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.rdbms.statementLogging
|How to log SQL statements. The default is to log the statement and replace any parameters with the value provided in angle brackets. 
Alternatively you can log the statement with any parameters replaced by just the values (no brackets). The final option is to log the raw JDBC statement (with ? for parameters).
{*values-in-brackets*, values, jdbc}

|datanucleus.rdbms.fetchUnloadedAutomatically
|If enabled will, upon a request to load a field, check for any unloaded fields that are non-relation fields or 1-1/N-1 fields and will load them in the same SQL call.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.cloud.storage.bucket
|This is a mandatory property that allows you to supply the bucket name to store your data. *Applicable for Google Storage, and AmazonS3 only.*

|datanucleus.hbase.relationUsesPersistableId
|This defines how relations will be persisted. The legacy method would be just to store the "id" of the object.
The default method is to use "persistableId" which is a form of the id but catering for datastore id and application id, and including the class of the target object to avoid subsequent lookups.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.hbase.enforceUniquenessInApplication
|Setting this property to true means that when a new object is persisted (and its identity is assigned), 
no check will be made as to whether it exists in the datastore and that the user takes responsibility for such checks.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.cassandra.enforceUniquenessInApplication
|Setting this property to true means that when a new object is persisted (and its identity is assigned), 
no check will be made as to whether it exists in the datastore (since Cassandra does an UPSERT) and that the user takes responsibility for such checks.
{true, *false*}

|datanucleus.cassandra.compression
|Type of compression to use for the Cassandra cluster.
{*none*, snappy}

|datanucleus.cassandra.metrics
|Whether metrics are enabled for the Cassandra cluster.
{*true*, false}

|datanucleus.cassandra.ssl
|Whether SSL is enabled for the Cassandra cluster.

|Socket connect timeout for the Cassandra cluster.

|datanucleus.cassandra.loadBalancingPolicy
|Sets the load balancing policy to use. *Applicable for Cassandra only.*
{round-robin, token-aware}

|datanucleus.cassandra.loadBalancingPolicy.tokenAwareLocalDC
|Sets the local DC to use for the load balancing policy. *Applicable for Cassandra only.*

[[pmf_close]]
== Closing PersistenceManagerFactory

Since the PMF has significant resources associated with it, it should always be closed when you no longer need to perform any more persistence operations.
For most operations this will be when closing your application. Whenever it is you do it like this

[source,java]
-----
pmf.close();
-----


include::_persistence_data_federation.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


[[cache_level2]]
== Level 2 Cache

The _PersistenceManagerFactory_ has an optional cache of all objects across all _PersistenceManager_s.
This cache is called the *Level 2 (L2) cache*, and JDO doesn't define whether this should be enabled or not. With DataNucleus it defaults to enabled.
The user can configure the L2 cache if they so wish; by use of the persistence property *datanucleus.cache.level2.type*. You set this to "type" of cache required.
You currently have the following options.

* *soft* - use the internal (soft reference based) L2 cache. *This is the default L2 cache in DataNucleus.*
Provides support for the JDO interface of being able to put objects into the cache, and evict them when required.
This option does not support distributed caching, solely running within the JVM of the client application. 
Soft references are held to non pinned objects.
* *weak* - use the internal (weak reference based) L2 cache. 
Provides support for the JDO interface of being able to put objects into the cache, and evict them when required.
This option does not support distributed caching, solely running within the JVM of the client application. 
Weak references are held to non pinned objects.
* link:#cache_level2_javax_cache[javax.cache] - a simple wrapper to the Java standard "javax.cache" Temporary Caching API.
* link:#cache_level2_ehcache[EHCache] - a simple wrapper to EHCache's caching product.
* link:#cache_level2_ehcache[EHCacheClassBased] - similar to the EHCache option but class-based.
* link:#cache_level2_redis[Redis] - an L2 cache using Redis.
* link:#cache_level2_coherence[Oracle Coherence] - a simple wrapper to Oracle's Coherence caching product. 
Oracle's caches support distributed caching, so you could, in principle, use DataNucleus in a distributed environment with this option.
* link:#cache_level2_memcached[spymemcached] - a simple wrapper to the "spymemcached" client for http://www.memcached.org[memcached] caching product.
* link:#cache_level2_memcached[xmemcached] - a simple wrapper to the "xmemcached" client for http://www.memcached.org[memcached] caching product. 
* link:#cache_level2_cacheonix[cacheonix] - a simple wrapper to the Cacheonix distributed caching software.
* link:#cache_level2_oscache[OSCache] - a simple wrapper to OSCache's caching product.
* *none* - turn OFF L2 caching.

The weak, soft and javax.cache caches are available in the datanucleus-core plugin.
The EHCache, OSCache, Coherence, Cacheonix, and Memcache caches are available in the http://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-cache[datanucleus-cache] plugin.

In addition you can control the _mode_ of operation of the L2 cache. You do this using the persistence property *datanucleus.cache.level2.mode*.
The default is _UNSPECIFIED_ which means that DataNucleus will cache all objects of entities unless the entity is explicitly marked as not cacheable. 
The other options are _NONE_ (don't cache ever), _ALL_ (cache all entities regardless of annotations),
_ENABLE_SELECTIVE_ (cache entities explicitly marked as cacheable), or _DISABLE_SELECTIVE_ (cache entities unless explicitly marked as not cacheable - i.e same as our default).

Objects are placed in the L2 cache when you commit() the transaction of a PersistenceManager. 
This means that you only have datastore-persisted objects in that cache. 
Also, if an object is deleted during a transaction then at commit it will be removed from the L2 cache if it is present.


NOTE: The L2 cache is a DataNucleus link:../extensions/extensions.html#cache_level2[image:../images/nucleus_extensionpoint.png[]] allowing you to provide your own cache where you require it. 
Use the examples of the EHCache, Coherence caches etc as reference.


=== Controlling the Level 2 Cache

The majority of times when using a JDO-enabled system you will not have to take control over any aspect of the caching other than specification of whether to use a *L2 Cache* or not. 
With JDO and DataNucleus you have the ability to control which objects remain in the cache. 
This is available via a method on the _PersistenceManagerFactory_.

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory(props);
DataStoreCache cache = pmf.getDataStoreCache();
-----

The _DataStoreCache_ interface http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.jdo/3.2/javax/jdo/datastore/DataStoreCache.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc]]
provides methods to control the retention of objects in the cache. You have 3 groups of methods

* *evict* - used to remove objects from the L2 Cache
* *pin* - used to pin objects into the cache, meaning that they will not get removed by garbage collection, and will remain in the L2 cache until removed.
* *unpin* - used to reverse the effects of pinning an object in the L2 cache. This will mean that the object can thereafter be garbage collected if not being used.

These methods can be called to _pin_ objects into the cache that will be much used. Clearly 
this will be very much application dependent, but it provides a mechanism for users to exploit 
the caching features of JDO. If an object is not "pinned" into the L2 cache then it can typically 
be garbage collected at any time, so you should utilise the pinning capability for objects that 
you wish to retain access to during your application lifetime. For example, if you have an object 
that you want to be found from the cache you can do

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory(props);
DataStoreCache cache = pmf.getDataStoreCache();
cache.pinAll(MyClass.class, false); // Pin all objects of type MyClass from now on
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();

    pm.makePersistent(myObject);
    // "myObject" will now be pinned since we are pinning all objects of type MyClass.

    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
    	tx.close();
    }
}
-----

Thereafter, whenever something refers to _myObject_, it will find it in the L2 cache. 
To turn this behaviour off, the user can either *unpin* it or *evict* it.

JDO allows control over which classes are put into a L2 cache. You do this by specifying the *cacheable* attribute to _false_ (defaults to true).
So with the following specification, no objects of type _MyClass_ will be put in the L2 cache.

[source,java]
-----
@Cacheable("false")
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="MyClass" cacheable="false">
    ...
</class>
-----

JDO allows you control over which fields of an object are put in the L2 cache.
You do this by specifying the *cacheable* attribute to _false_ (defaults to true).
This setting is only required for fields that are relationships to other persistable objects. Like this

[source,java]
-----
public class MyClass
{
    ...

    Collection values;

    @Cacheable("false")
    Collection elements;
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<class name="MyClass">
    <field name="values"/>
    <field name="elements" cacheable="false"/>
    ...
</class>
-----

So in this example we will cache "values" but not "elements". If a field is _cacheable_ then

* If it is a persistable object, the "identity" of the related object will be stored in the L2 cache for this field of this object
* If it is a Collection of persistable elements, the "identity" of the elements will be stored in the L2 cache for this field of this object
* If it is a Map of persistable keys/values, the "identity" of the keys/values will be stored in the L2 cache for this field of this object

When pulling an object in from the L2 cache and it has a reference to another object DataNucleus uses the "identity" to find that object in the 
L1 or L2 caches to re-relate the objects.


[[cache_level2_javax_cache]]
=== L2 Cache using javax.cache

DataNucleus provides a simple wrapper to any compliant
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[javax.cache implementation], for example
https://apacheignite.readme.io/[Apache Ignite] or https://hazelcast.org/[HazelCast].
To enable this you should put a "javax.cache" implementation in your CLASSPATH, and set the persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.type=javax.cache
datanucleus.cache.level2.cacheName={cache name}
-----

As an example, you could simply add the following to a Maven POM, together with those persistence properties above to use HazelCast "javax.cache" implementation

[source,xml]
-----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
    <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>3.7.3</version>
</dependency>

[[cache_level2_ehcache]]
=== L2 Cache using EHCache

DataNucleus provides a simple wrapper to http://www.sf.net/projects/ehcache[EHCache's own API caches] (not the javax.cache API variant). 
To enable this you should set the persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.type=ehcache
datanucleus.cache.level2.cacheName={cache name}
datanucleus.cache.level2.configurationFile={EHCache configuration file (in classpath)}
-----

The EHCache plugin also provides an alternative L2 Cache that is class-based. 
To use this you would need to replace "ehcache" above with "ehcacheclassbased".


[[cache_level2_memcached]]
=== L2 Cache using Spymemcached/Xmemcached

DataNucleus provides a simple wrapper to http://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/[Spymemcached caches] and http://code.google.com/p/xmemcached/[Xmemcached caches].
To enable this you should set the persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.type=spymemcached         [or "xmemcached"]
datanucleus.cache.level2.cacheName={prefix for keys, to avoid clashes with other memcached objects}
datanucleus.cache.level2.expireMillis=...
datanucleus.cache.level2.memcached.servers=...
-----

*datanucleus.cache.level2.memcached.servers* is a space separated list of http://www.memcached.org[memcached] hosts/ports, e.g. host:port host2:port.
*datanucleus.cache.level2.expireMillis* if not set or set to 0 then no expire


[[cache_level2_cacheonix]]
=== L2 Cache using Cacheonix

DataNucleus provides a simple wrapper to http://www.cacheonix.com/[Cacheonix].
To enable this you should set the persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.type=cacheonix
datanucleus.cache.level2.cacheName={cache name}
-----

Note that you can optionally also specify

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.expiryMillis={expiry-in-millis}
datanucleus.cache.level2.configurationFile={Cacheonix configuration file (in classpath)}
-----

and define a _cacheonix-config.xml_ like

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<cacheonix>
   <local>
      <!-- One cache per class being stored. -->
      <localCache name="mydomain.MyClass">
         <store>
            <lru maxElements="1000" maxBytes="1mb"/>
            <expiration timeToLive="60s"/>
         </store>
      </localCache>

      <!-- Fallback cache for classes indeterminable from their id. -->
      <localCache name="datanucleus">
         <store>
            <lru maxElements="1000" maxBytes="10mb"/>
            <expiration timeToLive="60s"/>
         </store>
      </localCache>

      <localCache name="default" template="true">
         <store>
            <lru maxElements="10" maxBytes="10mb"/>
            <overflowToDisk maxOverflowBytes="1mb"/>
            <expiration timeToLive="1s"/>
         </store>
      </localCache>
   </local>

</cacheonix>

[[cache_level2_redis]]
=== L2 Cache using Redis

DataNucleus provides a simple L2 cache using Redis.
To enable this you should set the persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.type=redis
datanucleus.cache.level2.cacheName={cache name}
datanucleus.cache.level2.clearAtClose={true | false, whether to clear at close}
datanucleus.cache.level2.expiryMillis={expiry-in-millis}
datanucleus.cache.level2.redis.database={database, or use the default '1'}
datanucleus.cache.level2.redis.timeout={optional timeout, or use the default of 5000}
datanucleus.cache.level2.redis.sentinels={comma-separated list of sentinels, optional (use server/port instead)}
datanucleus.cache.level2.redis.server={server, or use the default of "localhost"}
datanucleus.cache.level2.redis.port={port, or use the default of 6379}
-----


[[cache_level2_oscache]]
=== L2 Cache using OSCache

DataNucleus provides a simple wrapper to http://www.opensymphony.com/oscache/[OSCache's caches]. 
To enable this you should set the persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.type=oscache
datanucleus.cache.level2.cacheName={cache name}
-----


[[cache_level2_coherence]]
=== L2 Cache using Oracle Coherence

DataNucleus provides a simple wrapper to http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/coherence/index.html[Oracle's Coherence caches].
This currently takes the _NamedCache_ interface in Coherence and instantiates a cache of a user provided name.
To enabled this you should set the following persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.cache.level2.type=coherence
datanucleus.cache.level2.cacheName={coherence cache name}
-----

The _Coherence cache name_ is the name that you would normally put into a call to CacheFactory.getCache(name). 
You have the benefits of Coherence's distributed/serialized caching. 
If you require more control over the Coherence cache whilst using it with DataNucleus, you can just access the cache directly via

[source,java]
-----
JDODataStoreCache cache = (JDODataStoreCache)pmf.getDataStoreCache();
NamedCache tangosolCache = ((TangosolLevel2Cache)cache.getLevel2Cache()).getTangosolCache();
-----


=== Level 2 Cache implementation

Objects in a Level 2 cache are keyed by their JDO "identity". Consequently only persistable objects with an identity will be L2 cached.
In terms of what is cached, the persistable object is represented by a https://github.com/datanucleus/datanucleus-core/blob/master/src/main/java/org/datanucleus/cache/CachedPC.java[CachedPC]
object. This stores the class of the persistable object, the "id", "version" (if present), and the field values (together with which fields are present in the L2 cache).
If a field is/contains a relation, the field value will be the "id" of the related object (rather than the object itself). 
If a field is/contains an embedded persistable object, the field value will be a nested `CachedPC` object representing that object.
