[[one_one_relations]]
= 1-1 Relations
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/

You have a 1-to-1 relationship when an object of a class has an associated object of another class (only one associated object). 
It could also be between an object of a class and another object of the same class (obviously). 
You can create the relationship in 2 ways depending on whether the 2 classes know about each other (bidirectional), 
or whether only one of the classes knows about the other class (unidirectional). 
These are described below.

NOTE: For RDBMS a 1-1 relation is stored as a foreign-key column(s), or less likely as an entry in a join table. 
For non-RDBMS it is stored as a String "column" storing the 'id' (possibly with the class-name included in the string) of the related object.

NOTE: You cannot have a 1-1 relation to a long/int field! JDO is for use with object-oriented systems, not flat data.


[[one_one_uni]]
== Unidirectional (ForeignKey)

For this case you could have 2 classes, *User* and *Account*, as below.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

so the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, but not vice-versa. If you define the annotations for these classes as follows

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    ...

    @Column(name="USER_ID")
    User user;
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<package name="mydomain">
    <class name="User" table="USER">
        ...
    </class>

    <class name="Account" table="ACCOUNT">
        ...
        <field name="user">
            <column name="USER_ID"/>
        </field>
    </class>
</package>
-----

This contrasts with JPA mapping where you have to _explicitly_ specify that it is a one-to-one relation!

This will create 2 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), and `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*, with column `USER_ID`), as shown below.

Things to note :-

NOTE: *Account* has the object reference (and so owns the relation) to *User* and so its table holds the foreign-key

NOTE: If you call _PM.deletePersistent()_ on the end of a 1-1 unidirectional relation without the relation and that object is related to another object, an exception will typically be thrown 
(assuming the datastore supports foreign keys). To delete this record you should remove the other objects association first.

TIP: If you invoke an operation that will retrieve the one-to-one field, and you only want it to retrieve the foreign key value for later use 
(and *not* join to the related table) you specify the _recursion-depth_ as 0 for the field/property.



[[one_one_uni_join]]
== Unidirectional (JoinTable)

NOTE: Supported for RDBMS. Other datastores simply ignore the join table and store the relation in a column in the table of the object with the field.

For this case we have the same 2 classes, *User* and *Account*, as before.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

so the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, but not vice-versa and the relation is stored using a join table. 
A particular user could be related to several accounts. If you define the annotations as follows

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    ...

    @Persistent(table="ACCOUNT_USER")
    @Join
    User user;
}
-----

or with XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<package name="mydomain">
    <class name="User" identity-type="datastore">
        ...
    </class>

    <class name="Account" identity-type="datastore">
        ...
        <field name="user" persistence-modifier="persistent" table="ACCOUNT_USER">
            <join/>
        </field>
    </class>
</package>
-----

For RDBMS this will create 3 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*), and a join table `ACCOUNT_USER` as shown below.

image:../images/relationship_N_1_uni_db.png[]

If you wish to specify the names of the database tables and columns for these classes, you can use the attribute _table_ (on the `<class>` element), 
the attribute _table_ on the `<field>`, the attribute _name_ (on the `<column>` element) and the attribute _name_ (on the *column* attribute under `<join>`)


NOTE: In the case of non-RDBMS datastores there is no join-table, simply a "column" in the `ACCOUNT` table, storing the "id" of the related object




[[one_one_bi]]
== Bidirectional (ForeignKey)

For this case you could have 2 classes, *User* and *Account* again, but this time as below. Here the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, and also vice-versa.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}

public class User
{
    Account account;

    ...
}
-----


We create the 1-1 relationship with a single foreign-key. To do this you define the annotations as

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    ...

    @Column(name="USER_ID")
    User user;
}

public class User
{
    ...

    @Persistent(mappedBy="user")
    Account account;
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<package name="mydomain">
    <class name="User" table="USER">
        ...
        <field name="account" mapped-by="user"/>
    </class>

    <class name="Account" table="ACCOUNT">
        ...
        <field name="user">
            <column name="USER_ID"/>
        </field>
    </class>
</package>
-----

The difference is that we added _mapped-by_ to the field of *User*. This represents the bidirectionality.

This will create 2 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), and `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*). 
With RDBMS the `ACCOUNT` table will have a column `USER_ID` (since RDBMS will place the FK on the side without the "mapped-by"). Like this

image:../images/relationship_1_1_bi_db_singlefk.png[]

With non-RDBMS datastores both tables will have a column containing the "id" of the related object, that is `USER` will have an `ACCOUNT` column, and `ACCOUNT` will have a `USER_ID` column.

NOTE: When forming the relation please make sure that *you set the relation at BOTH sides* since DataNucleus would have no way of knowing which end is correct if you only set one end.

TIP: If you invoke an operation that will retrieve the one-to-one field (of the non-owner side), and you only want it to retrieve the foreign key value for later use 
(and *not* join to the related table) you can specify the _recursion-depth_ to 0 for the field/property.


[[one_one_bi_join]]
== Bidirectional (JoinTable)

NOTE: DataNucleus does not support a BIDIRECTIONAL 1-1 relation using a join table. It is not a use-case that is very common and is not part of the JDO spec. 
You could look at a unidirectional relation with join table, or model it using a foreign key.
