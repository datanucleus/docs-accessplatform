Persistence operations performed by the _PersistenceManager_ are typically managed in a _transaction_, allowing operations to be grouped together.
A Transaction forms a unit of work. The Transaction manages what happens within that unit of work, and when an error occurs the Transaction can roll back any changes performed. 
Transactions can be managed by the users application, or can be managed by a framework (such as Spring), or can be managed by a JavaEE container. 
These are described below.

* link:#transaction_local[Local transactions] : managed using the JDO Transaction API
* link:#transaction_jta[JTA transactions] : managed using the JTA UserTransaction API, or using the JDO Transaction API
* link:#transaction_container[Container-managed transactions] : managed by a JavaEE environment
* link:#transaction_spring[Spring-managed transactions] : managed by SpringFramework

[[transaction_local]]
== Locally-Managed Transactions

When using a JDO implementation such as DataNucleus in a JavaSE environment, the transactions are by default *Locally Managed Transactions*. 
The users code will manage the transactions by starting, committing or rolling back the transaction itself. 
With these transactions with JDO image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.jdo/3.2/javax/jdo/Transaction.html]
you would do something like

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    
    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
    pm.close();
}
-----

The basic idea with *Locally-Managed transactions* is that you are managing the transaction start and end.


[[transaction_jta]]
== JTA Transactions

When using a JDO implementation such as DataNucleus in a JavaSE environment, you can also make use of *JTA Transactions*. 
You need to define the persistence property *javax.jdo.option.TransactionType* setting it to _JTA_. 
Then you make use of JTA (or JDO) to demarcate the transactions. So you could do something like

[source,java]
-----
UserTransaction ut = (UserTransaction)new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/UserTransaction");
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
try
{
    ut.begin();
    
    {users code to persist objects}
    
    ut.commit();
}
finally
{
    pm.close();
}
-----

So here we used the JTA API to begin/commit the controlling (_javax.transaction.UserTransaction_).


An alternative is where you don't have a _UserTransaction_ started and just use the JDO API, which will start the _UserTransaction_ for you.

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin(); // Starts the UserTransaction behind the scenes
    
    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.commit(); // Commits the UserTransaction behind the scenes
}
finally
{
    pm.close();
}
-----

IMPORTANT: You need to set both transactional and nontransactional datasources, and the nontransactional cannot be JTA. The nontransactional is used for schema and sequence operations.



=== JTA TransactionManager

Note that the JavaEE spec does not define a standard way of finding the JTA TransactionManager, and so all JavaEE containers have their own ways of handling this.
DataNucleus provides a way of scanning the various methods to find that appropriate for the JavaEE container in use, but you can explicitly
set the method of finding the _TransactionManager_, by use of the persistence properties *datanucleus.transaction.jta.transactionManagerLocator* and, 
if using this property set to _custom_jndi_ then also *datanucleus.transaction.jta.transactionManagerJNDI* set to the JNDI location that stores the _TransactionManager_ instance.


[[transaction_container]]
== Container-Managed Transactions

When using a JavaEE container you are giving over control of the transactions to the container. 
Here you have *Container-Managed Transactions*. In terms of your code, you would do like 
the above examples *except* that you would OMIT the _tx.begin(), tx.commit(), 
tx.rollback()_ since the JavaEE container will be doing this for you.


[[transaction_spring]]
== Spring-Managed Transactions

When you use a framework like http://www.springframework.org[Spring] 
you would not need to specify the _tx.begin(), tx.commit(), tx.rollback()_ since that would be done for you.


[[transaction_nontransactional]]
== No Transactions

DataNucleus allows the ability to operate without transactions. 
With DataNucleus JDO this is enabled by default (see the 2 properties *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.read*, *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.write* set to _true_, the default). 
This means that you can read objects and make updates outside of transactions. This is effectively "auto-commit" mode.

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
    
{users code to persist objects}

pm.close();
-----

When using non-transactional operations, you need to pay attention to the persistence property *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.atomic*. 
If this is true then any persist/delete/update will be committed to the datastore immediately. 
If this is false then any persist/delete/update will be queued up until the next transaction (or _pm.close()_) and committed with that.


[[transaction_isolation]]
== Transaction Isolation

JDO provides a mechanism for specification of the transaction isolation level. 
This can be specified globally via the persistence property *datanucleus.transaction.isolation* (javax.jdo.option.TransactionIsolationLevel).
It accepts the following values

* *read-uncommitted* : dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur
* *read-committed* : dirty reads are prevented; non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur
* *repeatable-read* : dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are prevented; phantom reads can occur
* *serializable* : dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads are prevented

The default (in DataNucleus) is *read-committed*. An attempt to set the isolation level to an unsupported value (for the datastore) will throw a JDOUserException.
As an alternative you can also specify it on a per-transaction basis as follows (using the names above).

[source,java]
-----
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
...
tx.setIsolationLevel("read-committed");
-----


[[transaction_synchronisation]]
== JDO Transaction Synchronisation

There are situations where you may want to get notified that a transaction is in course of being committed or rolling back. 
To make that happen, you would do something like

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();

    tx.setSynchronization(new javax.transaction.Synchronization()
    {
        public void beforeCompletion()
        {
             // before commit or rollback
        }

        public void afterCompletion(int status)
        {
            if (status == javax.transaction.Status.STATUS_ROLLEDBACK)
            {
                // rollback
            }
            else if (status == javax.transaction.Status.STATUS_COMMITTED)
            {
                // commit
            }
        }
    });
    
    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
pm.close();
-----


[[transaction_readonly]]
== Read-Only Transactions

Obviously transactions are intended for committing changes. If you come across a situation where you don't want to commit anything under any 
circumstances you can mark the transaction as "read-only" by calling

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    tx.setRollbackOnly();

    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.rollback();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
pm.close();
-----

Any call to _commit_ on the transaction will throw an exception forcing the user to roll it back.




[[transaction_flushing]]
== Flushing

During a transaction, depending on the configuration, operations don't necessarily go to the datastore immediately, often waiting until _commit_. 
In some situations you need persists/updates/deletes to be in the datastore so that subsequent operations can be performed that rely on those being handled first. 
In this case you can *flush* all outstanding changes to the datastore using

[source,java]
-----
pm.flush();
-----

You can control the flush mode using the persistence property *datanucleus.flush.mode*. This has the following values

* *Auto* : auto-flush changes to the datastore when they are made. This is the default for pessimistic transactions.
* *Manual* : only flush on explicit calls to _pm.flush()_ or _tx.commit()_. This is the default for optimistic transactions.
* *Query* : only flush on explicit calls to _pm.flush()_ or _tx.commit()_, or just before a Query is executed.


image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

A convenient vendor extension is to find which objects are waiting to be flushed at any time, like this

[source,java]
-----
List<ObjectProvider> objs = ((JDOPersistenceManager)pm).getExecutionContext().getObjectsToBeFlushed();
-----



[[large_data_problems]]
== Transactions with lots of data

Occasionally you may need to persist large amounts of data in a single transaction. 
Since all objects need to be present in Java memory at the same time, you can get _OutOfMemory_ errors, or your application can slow down as swapping occurs. 
You can alleviate this by changing how you flush/commit the persistent changes.

One way is to do it like this, where possible,

[source,java]
-----
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    for (int i=0; i<100000; i++)
    {
        Wardrobe wardrobe = new Wardrobe();
        wardrobe.setModel("3 doors");
        pm.makePersistent(wardrobe);
        if (i % 10000 == 0)
        {
            // Flush every 10000 objects
            pm.flush();
        }
    }
    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
    pm.close();
}
-----

Another way, if one object is causing the persist of a huge number of related objects, is to just persist some objects without relations first, flush, and then
form the relations. This then allows the above process to be utilised, manually flushing at intervals.

You can additionally consider evicting objects from the Level 1 Cache, since they will, by default, be cached until commit.



[[transaction_savepoint]]
== Transaction Savepoints

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

JDBC provides the ability to specify a point in a transaction and rollback to that point if required, assuming the JDBC driver supports it.
DataNucleus provides this as a vendor extension, as follows

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOTransaction;

PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
JDOTransaction tx = (JDOTransaction)pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();

    {users code to persist objects}
    tx.setSavepoint("Point1");

    {more user code to persist objects}
    tx.rollbackToSavepoint("Point1");

    tx.releaseSavepoint("Point1");
    tx.rollback();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
pm.close();
-----
