Let's now try to understand the Query
http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.jdo/3.2/javax/jdo/Query.html[image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc]] API in JDO.
We firstly need to look at a typical Query.

Let's create a JDOQL string-based query to highlight its usage

[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery("SELECT FROM mydomain.Product p WHERE p.price <= :threshold ORDER BY p.price ASC");
List results = q.execute(my_threshold);
-----

In this Query, we implicitly select JDOQL by just passing in a query string to the method _PersistenceManager.newQuery(String)_, and the query is specified
to return all objects of type _Product_ (or subclasses) which have the price less than or equal to some threshold value and ordering the results by the price. 
We've specified the query like this because we want to pass the threshold value in as a parameter (so maybe running it once with one value, and once with a different value).
We then set the parameter value of our _threshold_ parameter. The Query is then executed to return a List of results. 
The example is to highlight the typical methods specified for a (JDOQL) string-based Query.




== Creating a query

The principal ways of creating a query are


* Specifying the query language, and using a single-string form of the query
[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery("javax.jdo.query.JDOQL", 
    "SELECT FROM mydomain.MyClass WHERE field2 < threshold PARAMETERS java.util.Date threshold");
-----
or alternatively
[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery("SQL", "SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE COL1 == 25);
-----
* A link:query.html#named["named" query], (pre-)defined in metadata (refer to metadata docs).
[source,java]
-----
Query<MyClass> q = pm.newNamedQuery(MyClass.class, "MyQuery1");
-----
* JDOQL : Use the link:query.html#jdoql[single-string] form of the query
[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery("SELECT FROM mydomain.MyClass WHERE field2 < threshold PARAMETERS java.util.Date threshold");
-----
* JDOQL : Use the link:query.html#jdoql[declarative API] to define the query
[source,java]
-----
Query<MyClass> q = pm.newQuery(MyClass.class);
q.setFilter("field2 < threshold");
q.declareParameters("java.util.Date threshold");
-----
* JDOQL : Use the link:query.html#jdoql_typed[Typed Query API] to define the query
[source,java]
-----
JDOQLTypedQuery<MyClass> q = pm.newJDOQLTypedQuery(MyClass.class);
QMyClass cand = QMyClass.candidate();
List<Product> results = q.filter(cand.field2.lt(q.doubleParameter("threshold"))).executeList();
-----


== Closing a query

When a query is executed it will have access to the results of that query.
Each time it is executed (maybe with different parameters) it will have separate results.
This can consume significant resources if the query returned a lot of records.

You close a query (and all query results) like this

[source,java]
-----
q.close();
-----

If you just wanted to close a specific query result you would call

[source,java]
-----
q.close(queryResult);
-----
where the _queryResult_ is what you were returned from executing the query.



[[named]]
== Named Query

With the JDO query API you can either define a query at runtime, or define it in the MetaData/annotations for a class and refer to it at runtime using a symbolic name. 
This second option means that the method of invoking the query at runtime is much simplified. 
To demonstrate the process, lets say we have a class called _Product_ (something to sell in a store). 
We define the JDO Meta-Data for the class in the normal way, but we also have some query that we know we will require, so we define the following in the Meta-Data.

[source,xml]
-----
<package name="mydomain">
    <class name="Product">
        ...
        <query name="SoldOut" language="javax.jdo.query.JDOQL"><![CDATA[
        SELECT FROM mydomain.Product WHERE status == "Sold Out"
        ]]></query>
    </class>
</package>
-----

So we have a JDOQL query called "SoldOut" defined for the class _Product_ that returns all Products (and subclasses) that have a _status_ of "Sold Out". 
Out of interest, what we would then do in our application to execute this query woule be

[source,java]
-----
Query<Product> q = pm.newNamedQuery(mydomain.Product.class,"SoldOut");
List<Product> results = q.executeList();
-----

The above example was for the JDOQL object-based query language. We can do a similar thing using SQL, so we define the following in our MetaData for our _Product_ class

[source,xml]
-----
<jdo>
    <package name="mydomain">
        <class name="Product">
            ...
            <query name="PriceBelowValue" language="javax.jdo.query.SQL"><![CDATA[
            SELECT NAME FROM PRODUCT WHERE PRICE < ?
            ]]></query>
        </class>
    </package>
</jdo>
-----

So here we have an SQL query that will return the names of all Products that have a price less than a specified value. 
This leaves us the flexibility to specify the value at runtime. So here we run our named query, asking for the names of all Products with price below 20 euros.

[source,java]
-----
Query<Product> q = pm.newNamedQuery(mydomain.Product.class, "PriceBelowValue");
q.setParameters(20.0);
List<Product> results = q.executeList();
-----

All of the examples above have been specifed within the <class> element of the MetaData. 
You can, however, specify queries below <jdo> in which case the query is not scoped by a particular candidate class. 
In this case you must put your queries in any of the following MetaData files

-----
/META-INF/package.jdo
/WEB-INF/package.jdo
/package.jdo
/META-INF/package-{mapping}.orm
/WEB-INF/package-{mapping}.orm
/package-{mapping}.orm
/META-INF/package.jdoquery
/WEB-INF/package.jdoquery
/package.jdoquery
-----



[[save_as_named]]
=== Saving a Query as a Named Query

DataNucleus JDO also allows you to create a query, and then save it as a "named" query for later reuse. You do this as follows

[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery("SELECT FROM Product p WHERE ...");
q.saveAsNamedQuery("MyQuery");
-----

and you can thereafter access the query via

[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newNamedQuery(Product.class, "MyQuery");
-----



[[query_extensions]]
== Query Extensions

The JDO query API allows implementations to support "extensions" and provides a simple interface for enabling the use of such extensions on queries.
An extension specifies additional information to the query mechanism about how to perform the query. 
Individual extensions will be explained later in this guide.

You set an extension like this

[source,java]
-----
q.extension("extension_name", value);
-----

[source,java]
-----
Map exts = new HashMap();
exts.put("extension1", value1);
exts.put("extension2", value2);
q.extensions(exts);
-----

With DataNucleus, all _extension names_ will begin with "datanucleus.".

The Query API also has methods _setExtensions_ and _addExtension_ that are from the original version of the API, but function the same as these methods quoted.


== Setting query parameters

Queries can be made flexible and reusable by defining parameters as part of the query, so that we can execute the same query
with different sets of parameters and minimise resources.

[source,java]
-----
// JDOQL Using named parameters
Query<Product> q = pm.newQuery(Product.class);
q.setFilter("this.name == :name && this.serialNo == :serial");

Map params = new HashMap();
params.put("name", "Walkman");
params.put("serial", "123021");
q.setNamedParameters(params);


// JDOQL Using numbered parameters
Query<Product> q = pm.newQuery(Product.class);
q.setFilter("this.name == ?1 && this.serialNo == ?2");

q.setParameters("Walkman", "123021");
-----

Alternatively you can specify the query parameters in the _execute_ method call.


[[compile]]
== Compiling a query

An intermediate step once you have your query defined, if you want to check its validity, is to _compile_ it. You do this as follows

[source,java]
-----
q.compile();
-----

If the query is invalid, then a JDOException will be thrown.



== Executing a query

So we have set up our query. We now execute it. We have various methods to do this, depending on what result we are expecting etc

[source,java]
-----
// Simple execute
Object result = q.execute();

// Execute with 1 parameter passed in
Object result = q.execute(paramVal1);

// Execute with multiple parameters passed in 
Object result = q.execute(paramVal1, paramVal2);

// Execute with an array of parameters passed in (positions match the query parameter position)
Object result = q.executeWithArray(new Object[]{paramVal1, paramVal2});

// Execute with a map of parameters keyed by their name in the query
Object result = q.executeWithMap(paramMap);

// Execute knowing we want to receive a list of results
List results = q.executeList();

// Execute knowing there is 1 result row
Object result = q.executeUnique();

// Execute where we want a list of results and want each result row of a particular type
List<ResultClass> results = q.executeResultList(ResultClass.class);

// Execute where we want a single result and want the result row of a particular type
ResultClass result = q.executeResultUnique(ResultClass.class);
-----


[[flushBeforeExecution]]
=== Extension : Flush before query execution

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When using optimistic transactions all updates to persistent objects are held until flush()/commit(). 
This means that executing a query may not take into account changes made during that transaction in some objects. 
DataNucleus allows an extension for calling flush() just before execution of queries so that all updates are taken into account.
You could specify this as a persistence property *datanucleus.query.flushBeforeExecution* (defaults to _false_) and it will apply to all queries.
Alternatively, to do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.extension("datanucleus.query.flushBeforeExecution","true");
-----




[[FetchPlan]]
== Controlling the execution : FetchPlan

When a Query is executed it executes in the datastore, which returns a set of results. 
DataNucleus could clearly read all results from this ResultSet in one go and return them all to the user, or could allow control over this fetching process. 
JDO provides a _fetch size_ on the link:persistence.html#fetch_groups[Fetch Plan] to allow this control. You would set this as follows

[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery(...);
q.getFetchPlan().setFetchSize(FetchPlan.FETCH_SIZE_OPTIMAL);
-----

_fetch size_ has 3 possible values. 

* *FETCH_SIZE_OPTIMAL* - allows DataNucleus full control over the fetching. 
In this case DataNucleus will fetch each object when they are requested, and then when the owning transaction is committed will retrieve all remaining rows 
(so that the Query is still usable after the close of the transaction).
* *FETCH_SIZE_GREEDY* - DataNucleus will read all objects in at query execution.
This can be efficient for queries with few results, and very inefficient for queries returning large result sets.
* *A positive value* - DataNucleus will read this number of objects at query execution. Thereafter it will read the objects when requested.


In addition to the number of objects fetched, you can also control which fields are fetched for each object of the candidate type. This is controlled via the _FetchPlan_.

For RDBMS any single-valued member will be fetched in the original SQL query, but with multiple-valued members this is not supported. 
However what will happen is that any collection/array field will be retrieved in a single SQL query for all candidate objects (by default using an EXISTS subquery); this avoids the "N+1" problem, 
resulting in 1 original SQL query plus 1 SQL query per collection member. Note that you can disable this by either not putting multi-valued fields in the FetchPlan, 
or by setting the query extension *datanucleus.rdbms.query.multivaluedFetch* to _none_ (default is "exists" using the single SQL per field).

For non-RDBMS datastores the collection/map is stored by way of a Collection of ids of the related objects in a single "column" of the object and so is retrievable in the same query.
See also link:persistence.html#fetch_groups[Fetch Groups].


=== Extension: Load results at commit

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus also allows an extension to give further control. As mentioned above, when the transaction containing the Query is committed, 
all remaining results are read so that they can then be accessed later (meaning that the query is still usable). 
Where you have a large result set and you don't want this behaviour you can turn it off by specifying a Query extension

[source,java]
-----
q.extension("datanucleus.query.loadResultsAtCommit", "false");
-----

so when the transaction is committed, no more results will be available from the query.


=== Extension: Ignore FetchPlan

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

In some situations you don't want all _FetchPlan_ fields retrieving, and DataNucleus provides an extension to turn this off, like this

[source,java]
-----
q.extension("datanucleus.query.useFetchPlan", "false");
-----


[[ignore_cache]]
== ignoreCache(), setIgnoreCache()

The ignoreCache option setting specifies whether the query should execute entirely in the back end, instead of in the cache.
If this flag is set to _true_, DataNucleus may be able to optimize the query execution by ignoring changed values in the cache.  
For optimistic transactions, this can dramatically improve query response times.

[source,java]
-----
q.ignoreCache(true);
-----



[[locking]]
== Control over locking of fetched objects

JDO allows control over whether objects found by a query are locked during that transaction so that other transactions can't update them in the meantime. 
To do this you would do

[source,java]
-----
Query q = pm.newQuery(...);
q.serializeRead(true);
-----

You can also specify this for all queries for all PMs using the persistence property *datanucleus.SerializeRead*.
In addition you can perform this on a per-transaction basis by doing

[source,java]
-----
tx.setSerializeRead(true);
-----

NOTE: If the datastore in use doesn't support locking of objects then this will do nothing



[[read_timeout]]
== Timeout on query execution for reads

[source,java]
-----
q.datastoreReadTimeoutMillis(1000);
-----

_Sets the timeout for this query (in milliseconds)._ 
Will throw a JDOUnsupportedOperationException if the query implementation doesn't support timeouts (for the current datastore).



[[write_timeout]]
== Timeout on query execution for writes

[source,java]
-----
q.datastoreWriteTimeoutMillis(1000);
-----

_Sets the timeout for this query (in milliseconds) when it is a delete/update._ 
Will throw a JDOUnsupportedOperationException if the query implementation doesn't support timeouts (for the current datastore).



[[loadResultsAtCommit]]
== Extension: Loading Large Result Sets at Commit()

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When a transaction is committed by default all remaining results for a query are loaded so that the query is usable thereafter. 
With a large result set you clearly don't want this to happen. So in this case you should set the extension *datanucleus.query.loadResultsAtCommit* to _false_.

To do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.addExtension("datanucleus.query.loadResultsAtCommit", "false");
-----



[[resultCacheType]]
== Extension: Caching of Results

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

When you execute a query, the query results are typically loaded when the user accesses each row. 
Results that have been read can then be cached locally.
You can control this caching to optimise it for your memory requirements. 
You can set the query extension *datanucleus.query.resultCacheType* and it has the following possible values

* _weak_ : use a weak reference map for caching (default)
* _soft_ : use a soft reference map for caching
* _hard_ : use a Map for caching (objects not garbage collected)
* _none_ : no caching (hence uses least memory)

To do this on a per query basis, you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.addExtension("datanucleus.query.resultCacheType", "weak");
-----



[[resultSizeMethod]]
== Extension: Size of Large Result Sets

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

If you have a large result set you clearly don't want to instantiate all objects since this would hit the memory footprint of your application. 
To get the number of results many JDBC drivers, for example, will load all rows of the result set. 
This is to be avoided so DataNucleus provides control over the mechanism for getting the size of results.
The persistence property *datanucleus.query.resultSizeMethod* has a default of _last_ (which means navigate to the last object, hence hitting the JDBC driver problem). 
On RDBMS, if you set this to _count_ then it will use a simple "count()" query to get the size.

To do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.addExtension("datanucleus.query.resultSizeMethod", "count");
-----


[[resultSetType]]
== Extension: Type of Result Set (RDBMS)

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

For RDBMS datastores, _java.sql.ResultSet_ defines three possible result set types.

* _forward-only_ : the result set is navegable forwards only
* _scroll-sensitive_ : the result set is scrollable in both directions and is sensitive to changes in the datastore
* _scroll-insensitive_ : the result set is scrollable in both directions and is insensitive to changes in the datastore

DataNucleus allows specification of this type as a query extension *datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetType*.

To do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.addExtension("datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetType", "scroll-insensitive");
-----

The default is _forward-only_. 
The benefit of the other two is that the result set will be scrollable and hence objects will only be read in to memory when accessed. 
So if you have a large result set you should set this to one of the scrollable values.



[[resultSetControl]]
== Extension: Result Set Control (RDBMS)

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus RDBMS provides a useful extension allowing control over the ResultSet's that are created by queries. 
Some properties are available that give you the power to control whether the result set is read only, whether it can be read forward only, the direction of fetching etc. 

To do this on a per query basis you would do

[source,java]
-----
query.addExtension("datanucleus.rdbms.query.fetchDirection", "forward");
query.addExtension("datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetConcurrency", "read-only");
-----

Alternatively you can specify these as persistence properties so that they apply to all queries for that PMF. Again, the properties are

* *datanucleus.rdbms.query.fetchDirection* - controls the direction that the ResultSet is navigated. By default this is forwards only. Use this property to change that.
* *datanucleus.rdbms.query.resultSetConcurrency* - controls whether the ResultSet is read only or updateable.

Bear in mind that not all RDBMS support all of the possible values for these options. That said, they do add a degree of control that is often useful.
