= JDO XML MetaData Reference (v{version})

:jdo:

JDO has always accepted Metadata in XML format. As described in the link:mapping.html[the Mapping Guide] this has to be contained in files with
particular filenames in particular locations (relative to the name of the class), and that this metadata is _discovered_ at runtime. 
You can provide JDO XML metadata, or alternatively ORM XML metadata, but with virtually identical format 
(the only difference being the top level element being _jdo_ in the former case and _orm_ in the latter case). 

This page defines the format of the XML Metadata and can be used for either the JDO XML metadata or the ORM XML metadata. 



Here is an example header for *package.jdo* files with http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/jdo_3_0.xsd[JDO XSD] specification

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<jdo xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/jdo"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/jdo http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/jdo_3_1.xsd" version="3.1">
    ...
</jdo>
-----

Here is an example header for *package.orm* files with http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm_3_0.xsd[ORM XSD] specification

[source,xml]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<orm xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm_3_0.xsd" version="3.0">
    ...
</orm>
-----


JDO expects the XML metadata to be specified in a file or files in particular locations in the CLASSPATH. 
For example, if you have a class _com.mycompany.sample.MyExample_, JDO will look for any of the following resources until it finds one (in the order stated) :-

-----
META-INF/package.jdo
WEB-INF/package.jdo
package.jdo
com/package.jdo
com/mycompany/package.jdo
com/mycompany/sample/package.jdo
com/mycompany/sample/MyExample.jdo
-----

In addition to the above, you can split your metadata definitions between JDO XML MetaData files. For example if you have the following classes

-----
com/mycompany/A.java
com/mycompany/B.java
com/mycompany/C.java
com/mycompany/app1/D.java
com/mycompany/app1/E.java
-----

You could define the metadata for these 5 classes in many ways -- for example put all class definitions in *com/mycompany/package.jdo*, 
or put the definitions for D and E in *com/mycompany/app1/package.jdo* and the definitions for A, B, C in *com/mycompany/package.jdo*, 
or have some in their class named MetaData files e.g *com/mycompany/app1/A.jdo*, or a mixture of the above. 
DataNucleus will always search for the metadata file containing the class definition for the class that it requires. 



As well as JDO XML metadata, you can (also) use ORM XML metadata to override particular datastore-specific things like table and column names. 
JDO expects any ORM XML metadata to be specified in a file or files in particular locations in the CLASSPATH. 
These filenames depend on the *javax.jdo.option.mapping* persistence property.
For example, if you have a class _com.mycompany.sample.MyExample_, and the persistence property is set to "mysql" then JDO will look for any 
of the following resources until it finds one (in the order stated) :-

-----
META-INF/package-mysql.orm
WEB-INF/package-mysql.orm
package-mysql.orm
com/package-mysql.orm
com/mycompany/package-mysql.orm
com/mycompany/sample/package-mysql.orm
com/mycompany/sample/MyExample-mysql.orm
-----

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

If your application doesn't make use of ORM metadata then you could turn off the searches for ORM Metadata files when a class is loaded up.
You do this with the persistence property *datanucleus.metadata.supportORM* setting it to false.



image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

By default any XML Metadata (JDO or ORM) will be validated for accuracy when loading it.
Obviously XML is defined by a DTD or XSD schema and so should follow that.
You can turn off such validations by setting the persistence property *datanucleus.metadata.xml.validate* to false when creating your PMF.
Note that this only turns off the XML strictness validation, and _not_ the checks on inconsistency of specification of relations etc.



What follows provides a reference guide to XML MetaData elements for what goes in an XML metadata file. 
Refer to the relevant XSD for precise details.

|Attribute
|Description
|Values

|cascade-persist
|JDO defines that when an object is persisted then all fields will also be persisted using "persistence-by-reachability". 
This extension allows you to turn off the persistence of a field relation.
|*true*, false

|cascade-update
|JDO defines that when an object is updated then all fields containing persistable objects will also be updated using "persistence-by-reachability". 
This extension allows you to turn off the update of a field relation.
|*true*, false

|cascade-refresh
|When calling PersistenceManager.refresh() only fetch plan fields of the passed object will be refreshed. 
Setting this to true will refresh the fields of related PC objects in this field
|true, *false*

|allow-nulls
|When the field is a collection by default it will not be allowed to have nulls present but you can allow them by setting this DataNucleus extension tag
|true, *false*

|Whether this field should be supplied when inserting into the datastore.
|*true*, false

|updateable
|Whether this field should be supplied when updating the datastore.

|implementation-classes
|Used to define the possible classes implementing this interface/Object field. 
This is used to limit the possible tables that this is a foreign key to (when this field is specified as an interface/Object in the class).
Value should be comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names
|

|key-implementation-classes
|Used to define the possible classes implementing this interface/Object key.

Value should be comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names
|

|strategy-when-notnull
|This is to be used in conjunction with the "value-strategy" attribute. 
Default JDO2 behaviour when you have a "value-strategy" defined for a field is to always create a strategy value for that field regardless 
of whether you have set the value of the field yourself. This extension allows you to only apply the 
strategy if the field is null at persistence. This extension has no effect on primitive field
types (which can't be null) and the value-strategy will always be applied to such fields.
|*true*, false

|relation-discriminator-column

[[property]]
== Metadata for property tag

These are attributes within the *<property>* tag (jdo/package/class/property). 
This is used to define the persistence behaviour of the Java Bean properties of the class to which it pertains. 
This element can be used to change the default behaviour and maybe not persist a property, or to persist something that normally isn't persisted. 
It is used, in addition, to define more details about how the property is persisted in the datastore. 

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]
|===
|Attribute
|Description
|Values

|name
|Name of the property. The "name" of a property is obtained by taking the getXXX, setXXX method names and using the XXX and making the first letter lowercase.
|

|persistence-modifier
|The persistence-modifier specifies how to manage each property in your persistent class. 
There are three options: persistent, transactional and none.
*persistent* means that your field will be managed and stored in the database on transaction commit.
*transactional* means that your field will be managed but not stored in the database; transactional fields values will be saved by JDO when you start your transaction and restored when you roll back your transaction.
*none* means that your field will not be managed.
|persistent, transactional, none

This defaults to true for primitive types, java.util.Date, java.lang.*, java.math.* etc and false for persistable, reference (Object, Interface) and container types.
|true, false

|serialized
|Whether this property should be stored serialised  into a single column of the table of the containing object.
|true, *false*

have a "value-strategy" defined for a field is to always create a strategy value for that field regardless 
of whether you have set the value of the field yourself. This extension allows you to only apply the 
strategy if the field is null at persistence. This extension has no effect on primitive field
types (which can't be null) and the value-strategy will always be applied to such fields.
