[[schema]]
= Datastore Schema
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/



Some datastores have a well-defined structure and when persisting/retrieving from these datastores
you have to have this _schema_ in place. DataNucleus provides various controls for creation
of any necessary schema components. This creation can be performed as follows

* At runtime, link:#schema-generation[as a one-off generate-schema step]. This is the recommended option since it is standard in JPA.
* One off task before running your application using link:#schematool[SchemaTool]
* At runtime, link:#schema-autogeneration[auto-generating tables as it requires them]

The thing to remember when using DataNucleus is that *the schema is under your control*.
DataNucleus does not impose anything on you as such, and you have the power to turn on/off all schema components.
Some Java persistence tools add various types of information to the tables for persisted classes, such as special columns, 
or meta information. 
DataNucleus is very unobtrusive as far as the datastore schema is concerned. 
It minimises the addition of any implementation artifacts to the datastore, and adds _nothing_ (other than any datastore identities, 
and version columns where requested) to any schema tables.


[[schema-generation]]
== Schema Generation for persistence-unit

DataNucleus JPA allows you to generate the schema for your _persistence-unit_ when creating an EMF. 
You can create, drop or drop then create the schema either directly in the datastore, or in scripts (DDL) as required.
See the associated persistence properties (most of these only apply to RDBMS).

* *javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action* which can be set to _create_, _drop_, _drop-and-create_ 
or _none_ to control the generation of the schema in the database.
* *javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action* which can be set to _create_, _drop_, _drop-and-create_ or 
_none_ to control the generation of the schema as scripts (DDL). 
See also _javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create.target_ and _javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop.target_ 
which will be generated using this mode of operation.
* *javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create.target* - this should be set to the name of a DDL script file that will be generated
when using _javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action_
* *javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop.target* - this should be set to the name of a DDL script file that will be generated
when using _javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action_
* *javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create.source* - set this to an SQL script of your own that will create some tables 
(prior to any schema generation from the persistable objects)
* *javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop.source* - set this to an SQL script of your own that will drop some tables
(prior to any schema generation from the persistable objects)
* *javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source* - set this to an SQL script of your own that will insert any data that you require to be available when your EMF is initialised


Some examples.

To create a database using the JPA entities, and load data

-----
javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action=create
javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source=/usr/local/MyStartUp.sql
-----


To create DDL for the JPA entities

-----
javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action=create
javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create.target=/usr/local/CreateTables.ddl
-----



[[schema-autogeneration]]
== Schema Auto-Generation at runtime

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

If you want to create the schema (_tables_ + _columns_ + _constraints_) during the persistence process, the property 
*datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll* provides a way of telling DataNucleus to do this. 
It's a shortcut to setting the other 3 properties to true.
Thereafter, during calls to DataNucleus to persist classes or performs queries of persisted data, whenever it encounters 
a new class to persist that it has no information about, it will use the MetaData to check the datastore for presence 
of the "table", and if it doesn't exist, will create it. 
In addition it will validate the correctness of the table (compared to the MetaData for the class), and any other 
constraints that it requires (to manage any relationships). 
If any constraints are missing it will create them.

* If you wanted to only create the "tables" required, and none of the "constraints" the property 
*datanucleus.schema.autoCreateTables* provides this, simply performing the tables part of the above.
* If you want to create any missing "columns" that are required, the property 
*datanucleus.schema.autoCreateColumns* provides this, validating and adding any missing  columns.
* If you wanted to only create the "constraints" required, and none of the "tables" the property 
*datanucleus.schema.autoCreateConstraints* provides this, simply performing the "constraints" part of the above.
* If you want to keep your schema fixed (i.e don't allow any modifications at runtime) then make sure that the
properties *datanucleus.schema.autoCreate{XXX}* are set to _false_


[[schema-validation]]
== Schema Generation : Validation

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus can check any existing schema against what is implied by the MetaData.
    
The property *datanucleus.schema.validateTables* provides a way of telling DataNucleus to validate any tables that it 
needs against their current definition in the datastore. If the user already has a schema, and want to make sure that their tables 
match what DataNucleus requires (from the MetaData definition) they would set this property to _true_. 
This can be useful for example where you are trying to map to an existing schema and want to verify that you've got the correct MetaData definition.

The property *datanucleus.schema.validateColumns* provides a way of telling DataNucleus to validate any columns of the 
tables that it needs against their current definition in the datastore. 
If the user already has a schema, and want to make sure that their tables match what DataNucleus requires (from the 
MetaData definition) they would set this property to _true_. 
This will validate the precise column types and widths etc, including defaultability/nullability settings. 
*Please be aware that many JDBC drivers contain bugs that return incorrect column detail information and so having this 
turned off is sometimes the only option (dependent on the JDBC driver quality).*

The property *datanucleus.schema.validateConstraints* provides a way of telling DataNucleus to validate any constraints 
(primary keys, foreign keys, indexes) that it needs against their current definition in the datastore. 
If the user already has a schema, and want to make sure that their table constraints match what DataNucleus requires 
(from the MetaData definition) they would set this property to _true_. 


== Schema Generation : Naming Issues

Some datastores allow access to multiple "schemas" (such as with most RDBMS).
DataNucleus will, by default, use the "default" database schema for the Connection URL and user supplied. 
This may cause issues where the user has been set up and in some databases (e.g Oracle) you want to write to a different 
schema (which that user has access to). To achieve this in DataNucleus you would set the persistence properties

-----
datanucleus.mapping.Catalog={the_catalog_name}
datanucleus.mapping.Schema={the_schema_name}
-----

This will mean that all RDBMS DDL and SQL statements will prefix table names with the 
necessary catalog and schema names (specify which ones your datastore supports).


== Schema Generation : Column Ordering

By default all tables are generated with columns in alphabetical order, starting with root class fields followed by 
subclass fields (if present in the same table) etc. 
This is not part of JPA but DataNucleus allows an extension to specify the relative position, such as

[source,java]
-----
@ColumnPosition(3)
-----

Note that the values of the position start at 0, and should be specified completely for all columns of all fields.


[[schema_read_only]]
== Schema : Read-Only

If your datastore is read-only (you can't add/update/delete any data in it), obviously you could just configure your 
application to not perform these operations. An alternative is to set the EMF as read-only, by setting the persistence 
property *datanucleus.ReadOnlyDatastore* to _true_.

From now on, whenever you perform a persistence operation that implies a change in datastore data, the operation will throw a _PersistenceException_.

DataNucleus provides an additional control over the behaviour when an attempt is made to change a read-only datastore. 
The default behaviour is to throw an exception. You can change this using the persistence property _datanucleus.readOnlyDatastoreAction_ 
with values of "EXCEPTION" (default), and "IGNORE". "IGNORE" has the effect of simply ignoring all attempted updates to readonly objects.

You can take this read-only control further and specify it just on specific classes. Like this

[source,java]
-----
@Extension(vendorName="datanucleus", key="read-only", value="true")
public class MyClass {...}
-----


[[schematool]]
== SchemaTool

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

*DataNucleus SchemaTool* currently works with RDBMS, HBase, Excel, OOXML, ODF, MongoDB, Cassandra datastores and is very simple to operate. It has the following modes of operation :

* *createDatabase* - create the specified database (catalog/schema) if the datastore supports that operation.
* *deleteDatabase* - delete the specified database (catalog.schema) if the datastore supports that operation.
* *create* - create all database tables required for the classes defined by the input data.
* *delete* - delete all database tables required for the classes defined by the input data.
* *deletecreate* - delete all database tables required for the classes defined by the input data, then create the tables.
* *validate* - validate all database tables required for the classes defined by the input data.
* *dbinfo* - provide detailed information about the database, it's limits and datatypes  support. Only for RDBMS currently.
* *schemainfo* - provide detailed information about the database schema. Only for RDBMS currently.

In addition for RDBMS, the *create*/*delete* modes can be used by adding "-ddlFile {filename}" and this will then not 
create/delete the schema, but instead output the DDL for the tables/constraints into the specified file.

For the *create*, *delete* and *validate* modes DataNucleus SchemaTool accepts either of the following types of input.

* A set of MetaData and class files. The MetaData files define the persistence of the classes they contain. The class files are provided when the classes have annotations.
* The name of a *persistence-unit*. The link:#persistenceunit[persistence-unit] name defines all classes, metadata files, and jars that make up that unit. 
Consequently, running DataNucleus SchemaTool with a persistence unit name will create the schema for all classes that are part of that unit.

IMPORTANT: if using SchemaTool with a persistence-unit make sure you omit _javax.persistence.schema-generation_ properties from your persistence-unit.*


Here we provide many different ways to invoke *DataNucleus SchemaTool*

* link:#schematool_maven[Invoke it using Maven], with the DataNucleus Maven plugin
* link:#schematool_ant[Invoke it using Ant], using the provided DataNucleus SchemaTool Ant task
* link:#schematool_manual[Invoke it manually from the command line]
* link:tools.html#eclipse[Invoke it using the DataNucleus Eclipse plugin]
* link:#schematool_programmatic[Invoke it programmatically from within an application]


[[schematool_maven]]
=== SchemaTool using Maven

If you are using Maven to build your system, you will need the DataNucleus Maven plugin. 
This provides 5 goals representing the different modes of *DataNucleus SchemaTool*. 
You can use the goals *datanucleus:schema-create*, *datanucleus:schema-delete*, *datanucleus:schema-validate* depending on whether you want to 
create, delete or validate the database tables. To use the DataNucleus Maven plugin you will may need to set properties 
for the plugin (in your `pom.xml`). For example

[cols="2,1,5", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Default
|Description

|api
|JDO
|API for the metadata being used (JDO, JPA). *Set this to JPA*

|ignoreMetaDataForMissingClasses
|false
|Whether to ignore when we have metadata specified for classes that aren't found

|catalogName
|
|Name of the catalog (mandatory when using _createDatabase_ or _deleteDatabase_ options)

|schemaName
|
|Name of the schema (mandatory when using _createDatabase_ or _deleteDatabase_ options)

|persistenceUnitName
|
|Name of the persistence-unit to generate the schema for (defines the classes and the properties defining the datastore). *Mandatory*

|log4jConfiguration
|
|Config file location for Log4J (if using it)

|jdkLogConfiguration
|
|Config file location for java.util.logging (if using it)

|verbose
|false
|Verbose output?

|fork
|true
|Whether to fork the SchemaTool process. Note that if you don't fork the process, DataNucleus will likely struggle to determine class 
names from the input filenames, so you need to use a persistence.xml file defining the class names directly.

|ddlFile
|
|Name of an output file to dump any DDL to (for RDBMS)

|completeDdl
|false
|Whether to generate DDL including things that already exist? (for RDBMS)
|===

So to give an example, I add the following to my `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
-----
<build>
    ...
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.datanucleus</groupId>
            <artifactId>datanucleus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>5.0.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <api>JPA</api>
                <persistenceUnitName>MyUnit</persistenceUnitName>
                <log4jConfiguration>${basedir}/log4j.properties</log4jConfiguration>
                <verbose>true</verbose>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
</build>
-----

So with these properties when I run SchemaTool it uses properties from the file `datanucleus.properties` at the root of the Maven project. 
I am also specifying a log4j configuration file defining the logging for the SchemaTool process. 
I then can invoke any of the Maven goals

-----
mvn datanucleus:schema-createdatabase      Create the Database (catalog/schema)
mvn datanucleus:schema-deletedatabase      Delete the Database (catalog/schema)
mvn datanucleus:schema-create              Create the tables for the specified classes
mvn datanucleus:schema-delete              Delete the tables for the specified classes
mvn datanucleus:schema-deletecreate        Delete and create the tables for the specified classes
mvn datanucleus:schema-validate            Validate the tables for the specified classes
mvn datanucleus:schema-info                Output info for the Schema
mvn datanucleus:schema-dbinfo              Output info for the datastore
-----


[[schematool_ant]]
=== Schematool using Ant

An Ant task is provided for using *DataNucleus SchemaTool*. It has classname *org.datanucleus.store.schema.SchemaToolTask*, and accepts the following parameters

[cols="2,5,2", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description
|values

|api
|API that we are using in our use of DataNucleus. *Set this to JPA typically*
|*JDO*, JPA

|persistenceUnit
|Name of the persistence-unit that we should manage the schema for (defines the classes and the properties defining the datastore).
|

|mode
|Mode of operation.
|*create*, delete, validate, dbinfo, schemainfo, createDatabase, deleteDatabase

|catalogName
|Catalog name to use when used in _createDatabase_/_deleteDatabase_ modes
|

|schemaName
|Schema name to use when used in _createDatabase_/_deleteDatabase_ modes
|

|verbose
|Whether to give verbose output.
|true, *false*

|ddlFile
|The filename where SchemaTool should output the DDL (for RDBMS).
|

|completeDdl
|Whether to output complete DDL (instead of just missing tables). Only used with ddlFile
|true, *false*
|===

The SchemaTool task extends the Apache Ant http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/java.html[Java task], 
thus all parameters available to the Java task are also available to the SchemaTool task.
    
In addition to the parameters that the Ant task accepts, you will need to set up your CLASSPATH to include the classes and MetaData files, 
and to define the following system properties via the _sysproperty_ parameter (not required when specifying the persistence props via the 
properties file, or when providing the _persistence-unit_)

[cols="2,4,1", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description
|Optional

|datanucleus.ConnectionURL
|URL for the database
|icon:check[]

|datanucleus.ConnectionUserName
|User name for the database
|icon:check[]

|datanucleus.ConnectionPassword
|Password for the database
|icon:check[]

|datanucleus.ConnectionDriverName
|Name of JDBC driver class
|icon:check[]

|datanucleus.Mapping
|ORM Mapping name
|icon:times[]

|log4j.configuration
|Log4J configuration file, for SchemaTool's Log
|icon:times[]
|===

So you could define something _like_ the following, setting up the parameters *schematool.classpath*, 
*datanucleus.ConnectionURL*, *datanucleus.ConnectionUserName*, *datanucleus.ConnectionPassword*(, *datanucleus.ConnectionDriverName*)
to suit your situation.


[[schematool_manual]]
=== Schematool Command-Line Usage

If you wish to call *DataNucleus SchemaTool* manually, it can be called as follows

-----
java [-cp classpath] [system_props] org.datanucleus.store.schema.SchemaTool [modes] [options]
    where system_props (when specified) should include
        -Ddatanucleus.ConnectionURL=db_url
        -Ddatanucleus.ConnectionUserName=db_username
        -Ddatanucleus.ConnectionPassword=db_password
        -Dlog4j.configuration=file:{log4j.properties} (optional)
    where modes can be
        -createDatabase : create the specified database (if supported)
        -deleteDatabase : delete the specified database (if supported)
        -create : Create the tables specified by the mapping-files/class-files
        -delete : Delete the tables specified by the mapping-files/class-files
        -deletecreate : Delete the tables specified by the mapping-files/class-files and then create them
        -validate : Validate the tables specified by the mapping-files/class-files
        -dbinfo : Detailed information about the database
        -schemainfo : Detailed information about the database schema
    where options can be
        -catalog {catalogName} : Catalog name when using "createDatabase"/"deleteDatabase"
        -schema {schemaName} : Schema name when using "createDatabase"/"deleteDatabase"
        -api : The API that is being used (default is JDO, but set this to JPA)
        -pu {persistence-unit-name} : Name of the persistence unit to manage the schema for
        -ddlFile {filename} : RDBMS - only for use with "create"/"delete" mode to dump the DDL to the specified file
        -completeDdl : RDBMS - when using "ddlFile" in "create" mode to get all DDL output and not just missing tables/constraints
        -v : verbose output
-----

*All classes, MetaData files, `persistence.xml` files must be present in the CLASSPATH.*
In terms of the schema to use, you either specify the "props" file (recommended), or you specify
the System properties defining the database connection, or the properties in the "persistence-unit".
You should only specify one of the modes above. Let's make a specific example and see the output from SchemaTool. 
So we have the following files in our application

-----
src/java/...                 (source files and MetaData files)
target/classes/...           (enhanced classes, and MetaData files)
lib/log4j.jar                (optional, for Log4J logging)
lib/datanucleus-core.jar
lib/datanucleus-api-jpa.jar
lib/datanucleus-rdbms.jar, lib/datanucleus-hbase.jar,  etc
lib/javax.persistence.jar
lib/mysql-connector-java.jar (driver for our database)
log4j.properties
-----

So we want to create the schema for our persistent classes. So let's invoke 
*DataNucleus SchemaTool* to do this, from the top level of our project. 
In this example we're using Linux (change the CLASSPATH definition to suit for Windows)

-----
java -cp target/classes:lib/log4j.jar:lib/datanucleus-core.jar:lib/datanucleus-{datastore}.jar:lib/mysql-connector-java.jar
      -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties
      org.datanucleus.store.schema.SchemaTool -create
      -api JPA -pu MyUnit

DataNucleus SchemaTool (version 5.0.0.release) : Creation of the schema

DataNucleus SchemaTool : Classpath
>>  /home/andy/work/DataNucleus/samples/packofcards/target/classes
>>  /home/andy/work/DataNucleus/samples/packofcards/lib/log4j.jar
>>  /home/andy/work/DataNucleus/samples/packofcards/lib/datanucleus-core.jar
>>  /home/andy/work/DataNucleus/samples/packofcards/lib/datanucleus-api-jpa.jar
>>  /home/andy/work/DataNucleus/samples/packofcards/lib/javax.persistence.jar
>>  /home/andy/work/DataNucleus/samples/packofcards/lib/datanucleus-rdbms.jar
>>  /home/andy/work/DataNucleus/samples/packofcards/lib/mysql-connector-java.jar

DataNucleus SchemaTool : Persistence-Unit="MyUnit"

SchemaTool completed successfully
-----

So as you see, *DataNucleus SchemaTool* prints out our input, the properties used, and finally a success message. 
If an error occurs, then something will be printed to the screen, and more information will be written to the log.


[[schematool_programmatic]]
=== SchemaTool API

DataNucleus SchemaTool can also be called programmatically from an application.
You need to get hold of the StoreManager and cast it to _SchemaAwareStoreManager_.
The API is shown below.

[source,java]
-----
package org.datanucleus.store.schema;

public interface SchemaAwareStoreManager
{
    void createDatabase(String catalogName, String schemaName, Properties props);
    void deleteDatabase(String catalogName, String schemaName, Properties props);

    void createSchemaForClasses(Set<String> classNames, Properties props);
    void deleteSchemaForClasses(Set<String> classNames, Properties props);
    void validateSchemaForClasses(Set<String> classNames, Properties props);
}
-----

So for example to create the schema for classes _mydomain.A_ and _mydomain.B_ you would do something like this
    
[source,java]
-----
EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("MyUnit");
PersistenceNucleusContext nucCtx = emf.unwrap(PersistenceNucleusContext.class);
...
List classNames = new ArrayList();
classNames.add("mydomain.A");
classNames.add("mydomain.B");
try
{
    Properties props = new Properties();
    // Set any properties for schema generation
    ((SchemaAwareStoreManager)nucCtx.getStoreManager()).createSchemaForClasses(classNames, props);
}
catch(Exception e)
{
    ...
}
-----

[[schema-adaption]]
== Schema Adaption

As time goes by during the development of your DataNucleus JPA powered application you may need to add fields, update field mappings, or delete fields.
In an ideal world the JPA provider would take care of this itself. However this is actually not part of the JPA standard and so you are reliant on 
what features the JPA provider possesses. 

DataNucleus can cope with added fields, if you have the relevant persistence properties enabled. In this case look at *datanucleus.schema.autoCreateTables*, 
*datanucleus.schema.autoCreateColumns*, *datanucleus.schema.autoCreateConstraints*, and *datanucleus.rdbms.dynamicSchemaUpdates* (with this latter property
of use where you have interface field(s) and a new implementation of that interface is encountered at runtime).

If you *update* or *delete* a field with an RDBMS datastore then you will need to update your schema manually. With non-RDBMS datastores deletion of fields
is supported in some situations.

You should also consider making use of tools like https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] and http://www.liquibase.org/[Liquibase] since these are designed for exactly this role.
