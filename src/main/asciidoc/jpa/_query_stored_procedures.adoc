NOTE: applicable to RDBMS.

The JPA specification supports calling stored procedures through its API.
It allows some flexibility in the type of stored procedure being used, supporting IN/OUT/INOUT parameters as well as result sets being returned. 
Obviously if a particular RDBMS does not support stored procedures then this functionality will not apply.

You start off by creating a stored procedure query, like this, referencing the stored procedure name in the datastore.

[source,java]
-----
StoredProcedureQuery spq = em.createStoredProcedureQuery("PERSON_SP_1");
-----

You should familiarise yourself with the StoredProcedureQuery 
image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.persistence/2.2/javax/persistence/StoredProcedureQuery.html] API.

If we have any parameters in this stored procedure we need to register them, for example

[source,java]
-----
spq.registerStoredProcedureParameter("PARAM1", String.class, ParameterMode.IN);
spq.registerStoredProcedureParameter("PARAM2", Integer.class, ParameterMode.OUT);
-----

If you have any result class, or result set mapping then you can specify those in the _createStoredProcedureQuery_ call.
Now we are ready to execute the query and access the results.


== Simple execution, returning a result set

A common form of stored procedure will simply return a single result set. You execute such a procedure as follows

[source,java]
-----
List results = spq.getResultList();
-----

or if expecting a single result, then

[source,java]
-----
Object result = spq.getSingleResult();
-----


== Simple execution, returning output parameters

A common form of stored procedure will simply return output parameter(s). You execute such a procedure as follows

[source,java]
-----
spq.execute();
Object paramVal = spq.getOutputParameterValue("PARAM2");
-----

or you can also access the output parameters via position (if specified by position).


== Generalised execution, for multiple result sets

A more complicated, yet general, form of execution of the stored procedure is as follows

[source,java]
-----
boolean isResultSet = spq.execute(); // returns true when we have a result set from the proc
List results1 = spq.getResultList(); // get the first result set
if (spq.hasMoreResults())
{
    List results2 = spq.getResultList(); // get the second result set
}
-----

So the user can get hold of multiple result sets returned by their stored procedure.


[[stored_procedures_named]]
== Named Stored Procedure Queries

Just as with normal queries, you can also register a stored procedure query at development time and then access it via name from the EntityManager. 
So we define one like this (not important on which class it is defined)

[source,java]
-----
@NamedStoredProcedureQuery(name="myTestProc", procedureName="MY_TEST_SP_1",
    parameters={@StoredProcedureParameter(name="PARAM1", type=String.class, mode=ParameterMode.IN})

@Entity
public class MyClass {...}
-----

and then create the query from the EntityManager

[source,java]
-----
StoredProcedureQuery spq = em.createNamedStoredProcedureQuery("myTestProc");
-----
