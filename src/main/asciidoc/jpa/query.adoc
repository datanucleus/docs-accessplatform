Once you have persisted objects you need to query them. 
For example if you have a web application representing an online store, the user asks to see all products of a particular type, ordered by the price. 
This requires you to query the datastore for these products. JPA specifies support for 

* link:#jpql[JPQL] : a string-based query language between SQL and OO.
* link:#criteria[Criteria] : following JPQL syntax but providing an API supporting refactoring of classes and the queries they are used in.
* link:#native[Native] : equates to SQL when using RDBMS, and CQL when using Cassandra.
* link:#stored_procedures[Stored Procedures] : in-datastore invocation of stored procedures for RDBMS datastores.

Which query language is used is down to the developer. 
The data-tier of an application could be written by a primarily Java developer, who would typically think in an object-oriented way and so would likely prefer *JPQL*. 
On the other hand the data-tier could be written by a datastore developer who is more familiar with SQL concepts and so could easily make more use of *SQL*.
This is the power of an implementation like DataNucleus in that it provides the flexibility for different people to develop the data-tier utilising their own skills 
to the full without having to learn totally new concepts.

There are 2 categories of queries with JPA :-

* *Programmatic Query* where the query is defined using the JPA Query API.
* *Named Query* where the query is defined in MetaData and referred to by its name at runtime(for link:#jpql_named[JPQL], link:#native_named[Native Query]
and link:#stored_procedures_named[Stored Procedures]).
