Once we have defined a class to be persistable (as either _Entity_, _MappedSuperclass_, or _Embedded_), we need to define how to persist the different 
fields/properties that are to be persisted. There are two distinct modes of persistence definition; the most common uses *fields*, whereas an alternative uses *properties*.


[[persistent_fields]]
== Persistent Fields

The most common form of persistence is where you have a *field* in a class and want to persist it to the datastore. 
With this mode of operation DataNucleus will persist the values stored in the fields into the datastore, and will set the values of the 
fields when extracting it from the datastore.

NOTE: Requirement : you have a field in the class. This can be public, protected, private or package access, but cannot be static or final.

An example of how to define the persistence of a field is shown below

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @Basic
    Date birthday;

    @Transient
    String someOtherField;
}
-----

So, using annotations, we have marked this class as persistent, and the field _birthday_ also as persistent, whereas field _someOtherField_ is not persisted.
Using XML MetaData we would have done

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="birthday"/>
        <transient name="someOtherField"/>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

Please note that the field Java type defines whether it is, by default, persistable. Look at the link:#field_types[Types Guide] and if the type has a tick in the column
"Persistent?" then you can omit the "basic" specification.



[[persistent_properties]]
== Persistent Properties

A second mode of operation is where you have Java Bean-style getter/setter for a *property*. In this situation you want to persist the output from _getXXX_ to the datastore, 
and use the _setXXX_ to load up the value into the object when extracting it from the datastore.

NOTE: Requirement : you have a property in the class with Java Bean getter/setter methods. These methods can be public, protected, private or package access, 
but cannot be static. The class must have BOTH getter AND setter methods.

An example of how to define the persistence of a property is shown below

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @Basic
    Date getBirthday()
    {
        ...
    }

    void setBirthday(Date date)
    {
        ...
    }
}
-----

So, using annotations, we have marked this class as persistent, and the getter is marked as persistent. By default a property is non-persistent, so we have no 
need in specifying the _someOtherField_ as transient. Using XML MetaData we would have done

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="birthday"/>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----


[[member_transient]]
== Making a field/property non-persistent

If you have a field/property that you don't want to persist, just mark it as _transient_, like this

[source,java]
-----
    @Transient
    String unimportantField;
-----


[[member_position]]
== Field/Property Positioning

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

With some datastores (notably spreadsheets) it is desirable to be able to specify the relative position of a column. 
The default (for DataNucleus) is just to put them in ascending alphabetical order.
JPA doesn't allow configuration of this, but DataNucleus provides the following vendor extension.
It is currently only possible using (DataNucleus) annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@Table(name="People")
public class Person
{
    @Id
    @ColumnPosition(0)
    long personNum;

    @ColumnPosition(1)
    String firstName;

    @ColumnPosition(2)
    String lastName;
}
-----


[[member_readonly]]
== Making a field/property read-only

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

If you want to make a member read-only you can do it like this.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="myField">
            <extension key="insertable" value="false"/>
            <extension key="updateable" value="false"/>
        </basic>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or with Annotations

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jdo.annotations.ReadOnly;

@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @ReadOnly
    String myField;

}
