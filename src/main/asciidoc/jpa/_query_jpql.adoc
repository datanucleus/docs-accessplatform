[[jpql]]
= JPQL
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/


The JPA specification defines JPQL (a pseudo-OO query language, with SQL-like syntax), for selecting objects from the datastore. 
To provide a simple example, this is what you would do

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.lastName = 'Jones'");
List results = q.getResultList();
-----

This finds all "Person" objects with surname of "Jones". You specify all details in the query.
The _Person_ specified in the query is the entity name of our entity. This defaults to the name of the class itself, but you can specify it explicitly in the mapping
if wanting to use something different.


[[jpql-select-syntax]]
== SELECT Syntax

In JPQL queries you define the query in a single string, defining the result, the candidate entity(s), the filter, any grouping, and the ordering. 
This string has to follow the following pattern

[source,java]
-----
SELECT [<result>]
    FROM <from_entities_and_variables>
    [WHERE <filter>]
    [GROUP BY <grouping>] [HAVING <having>]
    [ORDER BY <ordering>]
-----

The "keywords" in the query are shown in UPPER CASE, and are case-insensitive.

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

If you set the persistence property *datanucleus.query.jpql.allowRange* to _true_ then you can optionally also specify
the range of results required in the JPQL string after the ordering. It accepts the following format when this is specified

[source]
-----
SELECT [<result>]
    FROM <from_entities_and_variables>
    [WHERE <filter>]
    [GROUP BY <grouping>] [HAVING <having>]
    [ORDER BY <ordering>]
    [RANGE <fromInclusive>,<toExclusive>]
-----

where _fromInclusive_ is the first row to be returned (origin = 0), and _toExclusive_ is the row after the last one to be returned).



[[jpql_from]]
== FROM Clause

The FROM clause declares query identification variables that represent iteration over objects in the database. 
The syntax of the FROM clause is as follows:

-----
from_clause ::= FROM identification_variable_declaration {, {identification_variable_declaration | collection_member_declaration}}*
identification_variable_declaration ::= range_variable_declaration { join | fetch_join }*
range_variable_declaration ::= entity_name [AS] identification_variable

join ::= join_spec join_association_path_expression [AS] identification_variable [join_condition]
fetch_join ::= join_spec FETCH join_association_path_expression
join_association_path_expression ::= join_collection_valued_path_expression | join_single_valued_path_expression |
    TREAT(join_collection_valued_path_expression AS subtype) | TREAT(join_single_valued_path_expression AS subtype)

join_collection_valued_path_expression::= identification_variable.{single_valued_embeddable_object_field.}*collection_valued_field
join_single_valued_path_expression::= identification_variable.{single_valued_embeddable_object_field.}*single_valued_object_field
join_spec ::= [ LEFT [OUTER] | INNER ] JOIN
join_condition ::= ON conditional_expression
collection_member_declaration ::= IN (collection_valued_path_expression) [AS] identification_variable
-----

The FROM clause firstly defines the _candidate_ entity for the query. You can specify the candidate fully-qualified, or you can specify just the *entity name*. Using our example

-----
# Using candidate name fully qualified
SELECT p FROM mydomain.Person p


# Using entity name
SELECT p FROM Person p
-----

By default the *entity name* is the last part of the class name (without the package), but you can specify it in metadata

Firstly, in XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="mydomain.Person" name="ThePerson">
    ...
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity(name="ThePerson")
public class Person ...
-----


NOTE: If the candidate entity has a table using a discriminator, the generated SQL for RDBMS will include a restriction of the possible discriminator values to the candidate and any applicable
subclasses. If you want to override this and NOT have a discriminator restriction imposed in the SQL then you provide the query hint *datanucleus.query.dontRestrictDiscriminator* set to _true_.


NOTE: When using a candidate that has inherited subclasses that are also entities then the query can also return instances of these subclasses. 
You can set the query "hint" *datanucleus.query.excludeSubclasses* to _true_ to only get instances of the candidate entity.



The FROM clause also allows a user to add some explicit joins to related entities, and assign aliases to the joined entities. 
These are then usable in the filter/ordering/result etc. If you don't add any joins DataNucleus will add joins where they are 
implicit from the filter expression for example. The FROM clause is of the following structure

[source]
-----
FROM {candidate_entity} {candidate_alias}
    [[[ LEFT [OUTER] | INNER ] JOIN] join_spec [join_alias] [join_condition] *
-----

With JPQL you are explicitly stating that the join across _join_spec_ is performed as "LEFT OUTER" or "INNER" (rather than just leaving it to DataNucleus to decide which to use). 
Note that the _join_spec_ can be a relation field, or alternately if you have a Map of non-Entity keys/values then also the Map field. 
If you provide the _join_alias_ then you can use it thereafter in other clauses of the query. 
The _join_condition_ is an optional ON clause that is in addition to navigating along the relation that was specified.

Some examples of FROM clauses.

[source]
-----
# Join across 2 relations, allowing referral to Address (a) and Owner (o)
SELECT p FROM Person p JOIN p.address a JOIN a.owner o WHERE o.name = 'Fred'

# Join to a Map relation field and access to the key/value of the Map.
SELECT VALUE(om) FROM Company c INNER JOIN c.officeMap om ON KEY(om) = 'London'
-----

If you specify "LEFT OUTER FETCH" or "INNER FETCH" (i.e you specify *FETCH*) this means that you want those fields/properties fetching by this query. 
This doesn't mean that DataNucleus will definitely fetch them in the same query (because sometimes it is impossible to fetch things like multi-valued fields 
in a single query) but that it will attempt to fetch all fields that are selected (as well as the ones that are defaulted to EAGER).

NOTE: DataNucleus JPA also allows _RIGHT_ OUTER JOIN, though this is not part of the JPA spec.


=== FROM : Candidate that is @MappedSuperclass

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

In strict JPA the entity name cannot be a _MappedSuperclass_ entity name. That is, if you have an abstract superclass that is persistable, 
you cannot query for instances of that superclass and its subclasses. We consider this a significant shortcoming of the querying capability,
and allow the entity name to also be of a _MappedSuperclass_. 
You are unlikely to find this supported in other JPA implementations, but then maybe that's why you chose DataNucleus?


=== FROM : JOIN ON to another root

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

In strict JPA you cannot join to another "root" element. That is, you define JOIN syntax to the following element *along a relation*
from the previous element. DataNucleus supports joining to a (new) "root" element potentially without any relation. See this example

[source]
-----
SELECT p FROM Person p LEFT OUTER JOIN Address a ON p.addressName = a.name
-----

Here we simply chose an ON clause to join the two roots.


=== FROM : JOIN to an embedded element

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

In strict JPA you cannot join to an embedded element class (of an embeddable). With DataNucleus you can do this, and hence form queries
using fields of the embeddable (not available in most other JPA providers). See this example, where class _Person_ has a Collection 
of embeddable _Address_ objects.

[source]
-----
SELECT p FROM Person p LEFT OUTER JOIN p.addresses a WHERE a.name = 'Home'
-----


=== FROM : Control over INNER/OUTER join for implicit joins

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

*RDBMS* : By default if you don't specify the JOIN to some related object in the FROM clause and instead navigate through a 1-1/N-1 relation like "a.owner" then it will join using INNER JOIN. 
You can change this default by specifying the persistence property (to apply to all queries) or query extension *datanucleus.query.jpql.navigationJoinType* 
and set it to either "INNERJOIN" or "LEFTOUTERJOIN". 
You can also set the default for the _filter_ only using the persistence property(to apply to all queries) or query extension 
*datanucleus.query.jpql.navigationJoinTypeForFilter* and set it to either "INNERJOIN" or "LEFTOUTERJOIN". 


[[jpql_fetchplan]]
== Fetched Fields

By default a query will fetch fields according to their defined EAGER/LAZY setting, so fields like primitives, wrappers, Dates, and 1-1/N-1 relations will be fetched, 
whereas 1-N/M-N fields will not be fetched. JPQL allows you to include _FETCH JOIN_ as a hint to include relation fields where possible. 

For RDBMS datastores any multi-valued (1-N/M-N) field (Collection, array) will be _bulk-fetched_ if it is defined to be EAGER or has a _FETCH JOIN_, or is placed in the current EntityGraph. 
By _bulk-fetched_ we mean that there will be a single SQL issued per collection field (hence avoiding the N+1 problem). By default this will be a single SQL per collection
of the form `SELECT {relatedObject columns} FROM RELATED_TBL WHERE EXISTS (restrict to the candidate objects involved)`.
Note that you can disable this by either not marking multi-valued fields to be fetched, or by setting the query extension *datanucleus.rdbms.query.multivaluedFetch* to _none_
(default is _exists_ using the single SQL per field as mentioned above).

All non-RDBMS datastores do respect this FETCH JOIN setting, since a collection/map is stored in a single "column" in the object and so is readily retrievable.

Note that you can also make use of link:persistence.html#entity_graphs[Entity Graphs] to have fuller control over what is retrieved from each query.




[[jpql_filter]]
== WHERE clause (filter)

The most important thing to remember when defining the _filter_ for JPQL is that *think how you would write it in SQL, and its likely the same except for FIELD names instead of COLUMN names*. 
The _filter_ has to be a boolean expression, and can include 
link:#jpql_entities[the candidate entity], link:#jpql_fields_properties[fields/properties], link:#jpql_literals[literals], link:#jpql_functions[functions], 
link:#jpql_parameters[parameters], link:#jpql_operators[operators] and link:#jpql_subqueries[subqueries]


[[jpql_grouping]]
== GROUP BY/HAVING clauses

The GROUP BY construct enables the aggregation of values according to a set of properties. 
The HAVING construct enables conditions to be specified that further restrict the query result. 
Such conditions are restrictions upon the groups. The syntax of the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses is as follows:

[source]
-----
groupby_clause ::= GROUP BY groupby_item {, groupby_item}*
groupby_item ::= single_valued_path_expression | identification_variable

having_clause ::= HAVING conditional_expression
-----

If a query contains both a WHERE clause and a GROUP BY clause, the effect is that of first applying the where clause, 
and then forming the groups and filtering them according to the HAVING clause. 
The HAVING clause causes those groups to be retained that satisfy the condition of the HAVING clause. 
The requirements for the SELECT clause when GROUP BY is used follow those of SQL: namely, any item that appears in the SELECT clause 
(other than as an argument to an aggregate function) must also appear in the GROUP BY clause. In forming the groups, null values are 
treated as the same for grouping purposes. Grouping by an entity is permitted. In this case, the entity must contain no serialized 
state fields or lob-valued state fields. The HAVING clause must specify search conditions over the grouping items or aggregate functions that apply to grouping items.
If there is no GROUP BY clause and the HAVING clause is used, the result is treated as a single group, and the select list can only 
consist of aggregate functions. When a query declares a HAVING clause, it must always also declare a GROUP BY clause. 

Some examples

[source]
-----
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName FROM Person p GROUP BY p.lastName

SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName FROM Person p GROUP BY p.lastName HAVING COUNT(p.lastName) > 1
-----


[[jpql_ordering]]
== ORDER BY clause

The ORDER BY clause allows the objects or values that are returned by the query to be ordered. The syntax of the ORDER BY clause is 

[source]
-----
orderby_clause ::= ORDER BY orderby_item {, orderby_item}*
orderby_item ::= state_field_path_expression | result_variable {ASC | DESC}
-----

By default your results will be returned in the order determined by the datastore, so don't rely on any particular order. 
You can, of course, specify the order yourself. You do this using field/property names and _ASC_/_DESC_ keywords. For example

[source]
-----
field1 ASC, field2 DESC
-----

which will sort primarily by _field1_ in ascending order, then secondarily by _field2_ in descending order.


image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

Although it is not (yet) standard JPQL, DataNucleus also supports specifying a directive for where NULL values of the ordered field/property go in the order, so the full syntax supported is

[source]
-----
fieldName {ASC|DESC} {NULLS FIRST|NULLS LAST}
-----

NOTE: This is only supported for a few RDBMS including H2, HSQLDB, PostgreSQL, DB2, Oracle, Derby, Firebird, SQLServer v11+.


[[jpql_fields_properties]]
== Fields/Properties

In JPQL you refer to fields/properties in the query by referring to the field/bean name. 
For example, if you are querying a candidate entity called _Product_ and it has a field "price", then you access it like this

[source]
-----
price < 150.0
-----

Note that if you want to refer to a field/property of an entity you can prefix the field by its alias

[source]
-----
p.price < 150.0
-----

You can also chain field references if you have an entity Product (alias = p) with a field of (entity) Inventory, which has a field _name_, so you could do

[source]
-----
p.inventory.name = 'Backup'
-----

Note that you could alternatively have introduced a _join_ to Inventory first and then just referenced the _name_ field via the Inventory join alias.


[[jpql_operators]]
== Operators

The operators are listed below in order of decreasing precedence.

* Navigation operator (.)
* Arithmetic operators:
** +, - unary
** *, / multiplication and division
** +, - addition and subtraction
* Comparison operators : =, >, >=, <, <=, <> (not equal), [NOT] BETWEEN, [NOT] LIKE, [NOT] IN, IS [NOT] NULL, IS [NOT] EMPTY, [NOT] MEMBER [OF], [NOT] EXISTS
* Logical operators:
** NOT
** AND
** OR


[[jpql_literals]]
== Literals

JPQL supports literals of the following types : Number, boolean, character, String, _NULL_ and temporal.
For example, with a numeric literal

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.age = 25");
-----

When String literals are specified using single format JPQL they should be surrounded by single-quotes _'_. For example

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.firstName = 'John'");
-----

When temporal literals are specified using string format JPQL they use _JDBC escape syntax_ (see the JDBC spec for full details), namely

[source]
-----
{d 'yyyy-mm-dd'}                 - a Date
{t 'hh:mm:ss'}                   - a Time
{ts 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.f...'}  - a Timestamp
-----

For example

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.birthDate < {ts '1970-01-01 00:00:00.000000001'}");
-----


=== RDBMS : Parameters .v. Literals

When considering whether to embody a literal into a JPQL query, you should consider using a parameter instead. 
The advantage of using a parameter is that the generated SQL will have a '?' rather than the value. As a result, if you are using a connection pool
that supports PreparedStatement caching, this will potentially reuse an existing statement rather than generating a new one each time.
If you only ever invoke a query with a single possible value of the parameter then there is no advantage.
If you invoke the query with multiple possible values of the parameter then this advantage can be significant.


[[jpql_parameters]]
== Parameters

In JPQL queries it is convenient to pass in parameters so we don't have to define the same query for different values. Let's take two examples

[source,java]
-----
# Named Parameters :
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.lastName = :surname AND p.firstName = :forename");
q.setParameter("surname", theSurname);
q.setParameter("forename", theForename);

# Numbered Parameters :
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.lastName = ?1 AND p.firstName = ?2");
q.setParameter(1, theSurname);
q.setParameter(2, theForename);
-----

So in the first case we have parameters that are prefixed by *:* (colon) to identify them as a parameter and we use that name when calling _Query.setParameter()_.
In the second case we have parameters that are prefixed by *?* (question mark) and are numbered starting at 1. 
We then use the numbered position when calling _Query.setParameter()_.




[[jpql_case]]
== CASE expressions

For particular use in the _result_ clause, you can make use of a *CASE* expression where you want to return different things based on some condition(s). Like this

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery(
     "SELECT p.personNum, CASE WHEN p.age < 18 THEN 'Youth' WHEN p.age >= 18 AND p.age < 65 THEN 'Adult' ELSE 'Old' END FROM Person p");
-----

So in this case the second result value will be a String, either "Youth", "Adult" or "Old" depending on the age of the person.
The BNF structure of the JPQL CASE expression is

[source]
-----
CASE WHEN conditional_expression THEN scalar_expression 
    {WHEN conditional_expression THEN scalar_expression}* 
    ELSE scalar_expression 
END
-----


[[jpql_functions]]
== JPQL Functions

JPQL provides an SQL-like query language. Just as with SQL, JPQL also supports a range of functions to enhance the querying possibilities. 
The tables below also mark whether a particular method is supported for evaluation link:#jpql_inmemory[in-memory].


NOTE: These methods are not available for use with all of the supported datastores to be executed in-datastore. 
RDBMS, in general, supports the vast majority, whilst MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra support a select few methods in-datastore.

NOTE: You can add support for "in-memory" evaluation of other functions using this

NOTE: You can add "RDBMS datastore" support for other functions using this

[[jpql_collections]]
== Collection Fields

Where you have a collection field, often you want to navigate it to query based on some filter for the element. To achieve this, you can clearly 
link:#jpql_from[JOIN to the element in the FROM clause]. Alternatively you can use the _MEMBER OF_ keyword. Let's take an example, you have
a field which is a Collection of Strings, and want to return the owner object that has an element that is _"Freddie"_.

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName FROM Person p WHERE 'Freddie' MEMBER OF p.nicknames");
-----

Beyond this, you can also make use of the link:#jpql_functions_collection[collection functions] and use the size of the collection for example.



[[jpql_maps]]
== Map Fields

Where you have a map field, often you want to navigate it to query based on some filter for the key or value. 
Let's take an example, you want to return the value for a particular key in the map of an owner.

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT VALUE(p.addresses) FROM Person p WHERE KEY(p.addresses) = 'London Flat'");
-----

Beyond this, you can also make use of the link:#jpql_functions_map[map functions] and use the size of the map for example.

NOTE: in the JPA spec they allow a user to interchangeably use "p.addresses" to refer to the _value_ of the Map. Whilst DataNucleus supports
this, we advise using explicit _VALUE({field})_ since it is clearer the intent and makes for more readable queries.



[[jpql_subqueries]]
== Subqueries

NOTE: In strict JPQL you can only have subqueries in WHERE or HAVING clauses. DataNucleus additionally allows them in the SELECT, GROUP and ORDER clauses.

With JPQL the user has a very flexible query syntax which allows for querying of the vast majority of data components in a single query. 
In some situations it is desirable for the query to utilise the results of a separate query in its calculations. 
JPQL also allows the use of subqueries. Here's an example

[source]
-----
SELECT e FROM Employee e 
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT avg(f.salary) FROM Employee f)
-----

So we want to find all Employees that have a salary greater than the average salary.
The subquery must be in parentheses (brackets). Note that we have defined the subquery with an alias of "f", whereas in the outer query the alias is "e".


=== ALL/ANY/SOME Expressions

One use of subqueries with JPQL is where you want to compare with some or all of a particular expression. To give an example

[source]
-----
SELECT emp FROM Employee emp 
WHERE emp.salary > ALL (SELECT m.salary FROM Manager m WHERE m.department = emp.department)
-----

So this returns all employees that earn more than all managers in the same department! You can also compare with SOME/ANY, like this

[source]
-----
SELECT emp FROM Employee emp 
WHERE emp.salary > ANY (SELECT m.salary FROM Manager m WHERE m.department = emp.department)
-----

So this returns all employees that earn more than any one Manager in the same department.


=== EXISTS Expressions

Another use of subqueries in JPQL is where you want to check on the existence of a particular thing. For example

-----
SELECT DISTINCT emp FROM Employee emp
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT emp2 FROM Employee emp2 WHERE emp2 = emp.spouse)
-----

So this returns the employees that have a partner also employed.


[[jpql_candidates]]
== Specify candidates to query over

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

With JPA you always query objects of the candidate type in the datastore. DataNucleus extends this and allows you to provide
a Collection of candidate objects that will be queried (rather than going to the datastore), and it will perform the querying "in-memory". 
You set the candidates like this

[source,java]
-----
Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Products p WHERE ...");
((org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAQuery)query).getInternalQuery().setCandidates(myCandidates);
List<Product> results = query.getResultList();
-----


[[jpql_range]]
== Range of Results

With JPQL you can select the range of results to be returned. For example if you have a web page and you are paginating
the results of some search, you may want to get the results from a query in blocks of 20 say, with results
0 to 19 on the first page, then 20 to 39, etc. You can facilitate this as follows

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 20");
q.setFirstResult(0);
q.setMaxResults(20);
-----

So with this query we get results 0 to 19 inclusive.


[[jpql_result]]
== Query Result

The query result (SELECT) clause allows a user to select particular fields, objects etc.
The syntax of the query result clause is as follows:

[source]
-----
select_clause ::= SELECT [DISTINCT] select_item {, select_item}*
select_item ::= select_expression [[AS] result_variable]
select_expression ::= single_valued_path_expression | scalar_expression | aggregate_expression |
    identification_variable | OBJECT(identification_variable) | constructor_expression
constructor_expression ::= NEW constructor_name ( constructor_item {, constructor_item}* )
constructor_item ::= single_valued_path_expression | scalar_expression | aggregate_expression |
    identification_variable
-----


Whilst the majority of the time you will want to return instances of a candidate class, JPQL also allows you to return customised results. 
Consider the following example

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 20");
List<Object[]> results = q.getResultList();
-----

this returns the first and last name for each Person meeting that filter. 
Obviously we may have some container class that we would like the results returned in, so if we change the query to this

[source,java]
-----
Query<PersonName> q = em.createQuery(
    "SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 20", PersonName.class);
List<PersonName> results = q.getResultList();
-----

so each result is a PersonName, holding the first and last name. This result class needs to match one of the following structures

* Constructor taking arguments of the same types and the same order as the result clause. An instance of the result class is created using this constructor. For example
[source,java]
-----
public class PersonName
{
    protected String firstName = null;
    protected String lastName = null;
    public PersonName(String first, String last)
    {
        this.firstName = first;
        this.lastName = last;
    }
}
-----
* Default constructor, and setters for the different result columns, using the alias name for each column as the property name of the setter. For example
[source,java]
-----
public class PersonName
{
    protected String firstName = null;
    protected String lastName = null;
    public PersonName()
    {
    }
    public void setFirstName(String first) {this.firstName = first;}
    public void setLastName(String last) {this.lastName = last;}
}
-----
* Default constructor, and a method _void put(Object aliasName, Object value)_


Note that if the setter property name doesn't match the query result component name, you should use _AS {alias}_ in the query so they are the same.


=== Tuples

A special case, where you don't have a result class but want to easily extract multiple columns in the form of a *Tuple* JPA provides a special class 
_javax.persistence.Tuple_ to supply as the result class in the above call. From that you can get hold of the column aliases, and their values.

[source,java]
-----
Query<PersonName> q = em.createQuery(
    "SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName FROM Person p WHERE p.age > 20", Tuple.class);
List<Tuple> results = q.getResultList();
for (Tuple t : results)
{
    List<TupleElement> cols = t.getElements();
    for (TupleElement col : cols)
    {
        String colName = col.getAlias();
        Object value = t.get(colname);
    }
}
-----


== Query Execution

There are two ways to execute a JPQL query. When you know it will return 0 or 1 results you call

[source,java]
-----
Object result = query.getSingleResult();
-----

If however you know that the query will return multiple results, or you just don't know then you would call

[source,java]
-----
List results = query.getResultList();
-----


NOTE: When using RDBMS all parts of a query are evaluated *in-datastore*.
When using LDAP, Excel, ODF, XML, JSON, GoogleStorage, AmazonS3 any query filter/ordering etc is evaluated *in-memory*.
When using Neo4j, HBase, MongoDB and Cassandra any query filter/ordering etc are evaluated *in-datastore* where possible, with the remainder evaluated *in-memory*.



[[jpql_inmemory]]
=== Query Execution In-Memory

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

The typical use of a JPQL query is to translate it into the native query language of the datastore and return objects matched by the query. 
For many (usually non-RDBMS) datastores it is simply impossible to support the full JPQL syntax in the datastore _native query language_ and so it is
necessary to evaluate the query in-memory. This means that we evaluate as much as we can in the datastore and then instantiate those objects and evaluate further in-memory.
Here we document the current capabilities of _in-memory evaluation_ in DataNucleus.

* Subqueries using ALL, ANY, SOME, EXISTS are not currently supported for use in-memory.
* MEMBER OF syntax is not currently supported for use in-memory.

To enable evaluation in memory you specify the query hint *datanucleus.query.evaluateInMemory* to _true_ as follows

[source,java]
-----
query.setHint("datanucleus.query.evaluateInMemory","true");
-----



WARNING: In-memory JPQL evaluation does not support JOINs currently, or correlated subqueries. You should omit such things from your query
and try to evaluate them manually in your own code.



[[jpql_named]]
== Named Query

With the JPA API you can either define a query at runtime, or define it in the MetaData/annotations for a class and refer to it at runtime using a symbolic name. 
This second option means that the method of invoking the query at runtime is much simplified. To demonstrate the process, lets say we have a class called _Product_ 
(something to sell in a store). We define the JPA Meta-Data for the class in the normal way, but we also have some query that we know we will require, so we 
define the following in the Meta-Data.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="Product">
    ...
    <named-query name="SoldOut"><![CDATA[
    SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.status = "Sold Out"
    ]]></named-query>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@NamedQuery(name="SoldOut", query="SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.status = 'Sold Out'")
public class Product {...}
-----

NOTE: DataNucleus also supports specifying this using `@NamedQuery` annotation in non-Entity classes. This is beyond the JPA spec, but is very useful in real applications.


Above we have a JPQL query called "SoldOut" defined for the class _Product_ that returns all Products (and subclasses) that have a _status_ of "Sold Out". 
To execute this query we would do as follows

[source,java]
-----
Query query = em.createNamedQuery("SoldOut");
List<Product> results = query.getResultList();
-----


[[jpql_save_as_named]]
=== Saving a Query as a Named Query

You can save a query as a named query like this

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE ...");
...
emf.addNamedQuery("MyQuery", q);
-----


image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus also allows you to create a query, and then save it as a "named" query directly with the query. You do this as follows

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE ...");
((org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAQuery)q).saveAsNamedQuery("MyQuery");
-----

With both methods you can thereafter access the query via

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createNamedQuery("MyQuery");
-----


== JPQL : SQL Generation for RDBMS

With a JPQL query running on an RDBMS the query is compiled into SQL. Here we give a few examples of what SQL is generated. 
You can of course try this for yourself observing the content of the DataNucleus log, or by using the following vendor extension

[source,java]
-----
Query q = em.createQuery(...);
List results = q.getResultList();

String sql = (String)((org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAQuery)q).getNativeQuery();
-----

For non-RDBMS datastores this can return other object types.



In JPQL you specify a candidate class and its alias (identifier). In addition you can specify joins with their respective alias. 
The DataNucleus implementation of JPQL will preserve these aliases in the generated SQL.

[source]
-----
# JPQL:
SELECT p FROM Person p INNER JOIN p.bestFriend AS B

# SQL:
SELECT P.ID
FROM PERSON P INNER JOIN PERSON B ON B.ID = P.BESTFRIEND_ID
-----

With the JPQL _MEMBER OF_ syntax this is typically converted into an EXISTS query.

[source]
-----
# JPQL:
SELECT DISTINCT p FROM Person p WHERE :param MEMBER OF p.friends

# SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT P.ID FROM PERSON P
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM PERSON_FRIENDS P_FRIENDS, PERSON P_FRIENDS_1 
    WHERE P_FRIENDS.PERSON_ID = P.ID
    AND P_FRIENDS_1.GLOBAL_ID = P_FRIENDS.FRIEND_ID 
    AND 101 = P_FRIENDS_1.ID)
-----


[[jpql_delete]]
== JPQL DELETE Queries

The JPA specification defines a mode of JPQL for deleting objects from the datastore.
NOTE: his will not invoke any cascading defined on a field basis, with only datastore-defined Foreign Keys cascading. Additionally related objects already in-memory will not be updated.

[[jpql_delete_syntax]]
=== DELETE Syntax

The syntax for deleting records is very similar to selecting them

[source]
-----
DELETE FROM [<candidate-class> [[AS] {alias}]]  [WHERE <filter>]
-----

The "keywords" in the query are shown in UPPER CASE, and are case-insensitive.

[source,java]
-----
Query query = em.createQuery("DELETE FROM Person p WHERE firstName = 'Fred'");
int numRowsDeleted = query.executeUpdate();
-----


[[jpql_update]]
== JPQL UPDATE Queries

The JPA specification defines a mode of JPQL for updating objects in the datastore. 

NOTE: This will not invoke any cascading defined on a field basis, with only datastore-defined Foreign Keys cascading. Additionally related objects already in-memory will not be updated

[[jpql_update_syntax]]
=== UPDATE Syntax

The syntax for updating records is very similar to selecting them

[source]
-----
UPDATE [<candidate-class> [[AS] {alias}]] SET item1=value1, item2=value2  [WHERE <filter>]
-----

The "keywords" in the query are shown in UPPER CASE, and are case-insensitive.

[source,java]
-----
Query query = em.createQuery("UPDATE Person p SET p.salary = 10000 WHERE age = 18");
int numRowsUpdated = query.executeUpdate();
-----

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

In strict JPA you cannot use a subquery in the UPDATE clause. With DataNucleus JPA you can do this so, for example, you can set a field to the result of a subquery.

[source,java]
-----
Query query = em.createQuery("UPDATE Person p SET p.salary = (SELECT MAX(p2.salary) FROM Person p2 WHERE age < 18) WHERE age = 18");
-----


== JPQL Syntax Strictness

By default DataNucleus allows some extensions in syntax over strict JPQL (as defined by the JPA spec). To allow only strict JPQL you can do as follows

[source,java]
-----
Query query = em.createQuery(...);
query.setHint("datanucleus.query.jpql.strict", "true");
-----
