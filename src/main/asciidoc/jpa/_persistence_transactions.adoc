Persistence operations performed by the _EntityManager_ are typically managed in a _transaction_, allowing operations to be grouped together.
A Transaction forms a unit of work. The Transaction manages what happens within that unit of work, and when an error occurs the Transaction can roll back any changes performed. 
Transactions can be managed by the users application, or can be managed by a framework (such as Spring), or can be managed by a JavaEE container. 
These are described below.

[[transaction_local]]
== Locally-Managed Transactions

If using DataNucleus JPA in a JavaSE environment the normal type of transaction is _RESOURCE_LOCAL_.
With this type of transaction the user manages the transactions themselves, starting, committing or rolling back the transaction. 
With these transactions with JPA you obtain an _EntityTransaction_ 
image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/javax.persistence/2.2/javax/persistence/EntityTransaction.html] from the _EntityManager_,
and manage it like this

[source,java]
-----
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    
    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
em.close();
-----

In this case you will have defined your link:#persistenceunit[persistence-unit] to be like this

[source,xml]
-----
<persistence-unit name="MyUnit" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">
    <properties>
        <property key="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mysql:..."/>
        ...
    </properties>
    ...
</persistence-unit>
-----

or

[source,xml]
-----
<persistence-unit name="MyUnit" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">
    <non-jta-data-source>java:comp/env/myDS</properties>
    ...
</persistence-unit>
-----

The basic idea with *Locally-Managed transactions* is that you are managing the transaction start and end.


[[transaction_jta]]
== JTA Transactions

NOTE: Strict JPA does not support use of JTA transactions in a JavaSE environment. DataNucleus does however allow JTA transactions in a JavaSE environment.

The other type of transaction with JPA is using JTA. With this type, where you have a JTA data source from which you have a _UserTransaction_. 
This _UserTransaction_ can have resources "joined" to it. In the case of JPA, you have two scenarios. 
The first scenario is where you have the _UserTransaction_ created before you create your _EntityManager_. 
The create of the _EntityManager_ will automatically join it to the current _UserTransaction_, like this

[source,java]
-----
UserTransaction ut = (UserTransaction)new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/UserTransaction");
ut.setTransactionTimeout(300);

EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
try
{
    ut.begin();

    .. perform persistence/query operations

    ut.commit();
}
finally
{
    em.close();
}
-----

so we control the transaction using the _UserTransaction_.

The second scenario is where the _UserTransaction_ is started after you have the _EntityManager_. 
In this case we need to join our _EntityManager_ to the newly created _UserTransaction_, like this

[source,java]
-----
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
try
{
    .. perform persistence, query operations

    UserTransaction ut = (UserTransaction)new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/UserTransaction");
    ut.setTransactionTimeout(300);
    ut.begin();

    // Join the EntityManager operations to this UserTransaction
    em.joinTransaction();

    // Commit the persistence/query operations performed above
    ut.commit();
}
finally
{
    em.close();
}
-----

In the JTA case you will have defined your link:#persistenceunit[persistence-unit] to be like this

[source,xml]
-----
<persistence-unit name="MyUnit" transaction-type="JTA">
    <jta-data-source>java:comp/env/myDS</properties>
    ...
</persistence-unit>
-----

=== JTA TransactionManager

Note that the JavaEE spec does not define a standard way of finding the JTA TransactionManager, and so all JavaEE containers have their own ways of handling this.
DataNucleus provides a way of scanning the various methods to find that appropriate for the JavaEE container in use, but you can explicitly
set the method of finding the _TransactionManager_, by use of the persistence properties *datanucleus.transaction.jta.transactionManagerLocator* and, 
if using this property set to _custom_jndi_ then also *datanucleus.transaction.jta.transactionManagerJNDI* set to the JNDI location that stores the _TransactionManager_ instance.


[[transaction_container]]
== Container-Managed Transactions

When using a JavaEE container you are giving over control of the transactions to the container. 
Here you have *Container-Managed Transactions*. In terms of your code, you would do like 
the above examples *except* that you would OMIT the _tx.begin(), tx.commit(), 
tx.rollback()_ since the JavaEE container will be doing this for you.


[[transaction_spring]]
== Spring-Managed Transactions

When you use a framework like http://www.springframework.org[Spring] 
you would not need to specify the _tx.begin(), tx.commit(), tx.rollback()_ since that would be done for you.


[[transaction_nontransactional]]
== No Transactions

DataNucleus allows the ability to operate without transactions. 
With JPA this is enabled by default (see the 2 properties *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.read*, *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.write* set to _true_, the default). 
This means that you can read objects and make updates outside of transactions. This is effectively an "auto-commit" mode.

[source,java]
-----
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
    
{users code to persist objects}

em.close();
-----

When using non-transactional operations, you need to pay attention to the persistence property *datanucleus.transaction.nontx.atomic*. 
If this is true then any persist/delete/update will be committed to the datastore immediately. 
If this is false then any persist/delete/update will be queued up until the next transaction (or _em.close()_) and committed with that.

NOTE: Some other JPA providers do not provide this flexibility of non-transactional handling, and indeed, if you try to do updates when outside a transaction these
changes are not committed even at _em.close_ with those JPA providers. Fortunately you're using DataNucleus and it doesn't have that problem.




[[transaction_isolation]]
== Transaction Isolation

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus also allows specification of the transaction isolation level, applied at the connection level, and providing a level of isolation
of this process from other processed using the same database. 
The isolation is specified via the persistence property *datanucleus.transaction.isolation*. It accepts the standard JDBC values of

* *read-uncommitted* (1) : dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur
* *read-committed* (2) : dirty reads are prevented; non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur. *This is the default*
* *repeatable-read* (4) : dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are prevented; phantom reads can occur
* *serializable* (8) : dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads are prevented

If the datastore doesn't support a particular isolation level then it will silently be changed to one that is supported. 
As an alternative you can also specify it on a per-transaction basis as follows

[source,java]
-----
org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAEntityTransaction tx = (org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAEntityTransaction)em.getTransaction();
tx.setOption("transaction.isolation", "read-committed");
-----

Alternatively with numeric input (using numbers in parentheses above).

[source,java]
-----
org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAEntityTransaction tx = (org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAEntityTransaction)em.getTransaction();
tx.setOption("transaction.isolation", 2);
-----



[[transaction_readonly]]
== Read-Only Transactions

Obviously transactions are intended for committing changes. 
If you come across a situation where you don't want to commit anything under any circumstances you can mark the transaction as "read-only" by calling

[source,java]
-----
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
Transaction tx = em.getTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    tx.setRollbackOnly();

    {users code to persist objects}
    
    tx.rollback();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
em.close();
-----

Any call to _commit_ on the transaction will throw an exception forcing the user to roll it back.


[[transaction_flushing]]
== Flushing

During a transaction, depending on the configuration, operations don't necessarily go to the datastore immediately, often waiting until _commit_. 
In some situations you need persists/updates/deletes to be in the datastore so that subsequent operations can be performed that rely on those being handled first. 
In this case you can *flush* all outstanding changes to the datastore using

[source,java]
-----
em.flush();
-----

You can control the _flush mode_ for an EntityManager using

[source,java]
-----
em.setFlushMode(FlushModeType.COMMIT);
-----
which will only flush changes at commit. This means that when a query is performed it will not see any local changes.

The default is FlushModeType.AUTO which will flush just before any query, so that the results of all queries are consistent with local changes.




image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

A convenient vendor extension is to find which objects are waiting to be flushed at any time, like this

[source,java]
-----
List<ObjectProvider> objs = em.unwrap(ExecutionContext.class).getObjectsToBeFlushed();
-----



[[large_data_problems]]
== Transactions with lots of data

Occasionally you may need to persist large amounts of data in a single transaction. 
Since all objects need to be present in Java memory at the same time, you can get _OutOfMemory_ errors, or your application can slow down as swapping occurs. 
You can alleviate this by changing how you flush/commit the persistent changes.

One way is to do it like this, where possible,

[source,java]
-----
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();
    for (int i=0; i<100000; i++)
    {
        Wardrobe wardrobe = new Wardrobe();
        wardrobe.setModel("3 doors");
        em.persist(wardrobe);
        if (i % 10000 == 0)
        {
            // Flush every 10000 objects
            em.flush();
        }
    }
    tx.commit();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
    em.close();
}
-----

Another way, if one object is causing the persist of a huge number of related objects, is to just persist some objects without relations first, flush, and then
form the relations. This then allows the above process to be utilised, manually flushing at intervals.

You can additionally consider evicting objects from the Level 1 Cache, since they will, by default, be cached until commit.



[[transaction_savepoint]]
== Transaction Savepoints

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS

JDBC provides the ability to specify a point in a transaction and rollback to that point if required, assuming the JDBC driver supports it.
DataNucleus provides this as a vendor extension, as follows

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jpa.JPAEntityTransaction;

EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
JPAEntityTransaction tx = (JPAEntityTransaction)em.getTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin();

    {users code to persist objects}
    tx.setSavepoint("Point1");

    {more user code to persist objects}
    tx.rollbackToSavepoint("Point1");

    tx.releaseSavepoint("Point1");
    tx.rollback();
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback();
    }
}
em.close();
-----
