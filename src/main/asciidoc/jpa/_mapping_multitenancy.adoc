On occasion you need to share a data model with other user-groups or other applications and where the model is persisted to the same structure of datastore. 
There are three ways of handling this with DataNucleus.

* *Separate Database per Tenant* - have a different database per user-group/application.
In this case you will have a separate EMF for each database, and manage use of the appropriate EMF yourself.
* *Separate Schema per Tenant* - as the first option, except use different schemas.
In this case you will have a separate EMF for each database schema, and manage use of the appropriate EMF yourself.
* *Same Database/Schema but with a Discriminator in affected Table(s)* - this is described below.
In this case you will have a single EMF, and DataNucleus will manage selecting appropriate data for the tenant in question. This is described below.



== Multitenancy via Discriminator in Table

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, HBase, MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra

To define that a class is to be "multi-tenant" and hence have a discriminator column added you need to do as follows.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="mydomain.MyClass">
     <extension key="multitenant" value="true"/>
     <extension key="multitenancy-column-name" value="TENANT"/>
     <extension key="multitenancy-column-length" value="24"/>
     ...
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@MultiTenant(column="TENANT", columnLength=24)
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

By default (without the specification of column name/length) this will add a column *TENANT_ID* to each primary table, of String-based (255) type.

NOTE: In all DataNucleus prior to v6.0.0-m3 you enabled multitenancy globally (so the discriminator was always added, and you had to disable on a class-by-class basis).
This is now changed so that you *explicitly* define which classes need a multitenancy discriminator.
