[[versioning]]
= Versioning
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/

JPA allows objects of classes to be versioned. The version is typically used as a way of detecting if the object has been updated by another thread or 
EntityManager since retrieval using the current EntityManager - for use by link:persistence.html#locking_optimistic[Optimistic Locking].

[[version_member]]
== Version Field/Property

The standard JPA mechanism for versioning of objects is to mark a field of the class to store the version. 

NOTE: The field must be of one of the following types : int, _java.lang.Integer_, long, _java.lang.Long_, short, _java.lang.Short_, _java.sql.Timestamp_.


With JPA you can specify the details of this *version field* as follows

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class User
{
    ...

    @Version
    int version;

    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.User">
    <attributes>
        ...
        <version name="version"/>
        ...
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

The specification above will use the "version" field for storing the version of the object. DataNucleus will use a "version-number" strategy for populating the value.


[[surrogate_version]]
== Surrogate Version for Class

While the above mechanism should always be used for portability, DataNucleus also supports a surrogate version for objects of a class. 
With this you don't have a particular field that stores the version and instead DataNucleus persists the version in the datastore with the
field values in its own "column". You do this as follows.

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jpa.annotations.SurrogateVersion;

@Entity
@SurrogateVersion
public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.User">
    <surrogate-version column="version"/>
    ...
</entity>
-----

To access the "surrogate" version, you can make use of the following method

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jpa.NucleusJPAHelper;

Object version = NucleusJPAHelper.getSurrogateVersionForEntity(obj);
