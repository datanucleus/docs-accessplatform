[[identity]]

:_basedir: ../

All JPA-enabled persistable classes need to have an "identity" to be able to identify an object for retrieval and relationships. 
In strict JPA there is only 1 type of identity - _application identity_, where you have a field or field(s) of the entity that are used to define the identity.
With DataNucleus JPA we allow 2 additional types of identity. So your options are

* link:#application_identity[Application Identity] : a field, or several fields of the persistable type are assigned as being (part of) the primary key.
* link:#datastore_identity[Datastore Identity] : a surrogate column is added to the persistence of the persistable type, and objects of this type are identified by
the class plus the value in this surrogate column. *DataNucleus Extension*
* link:#nondurable_identity[Nondurable Identity] : the persistable type has no identity as such, so the only way to lookup objects of this type would be
via query for values of specific fields. This is useful for storing things like log messages etc. *DataNucleus Extension*

A further complication is where you use _application identity_ but one of the fields forming the primary key is a relation field. 
This is known as link:#derived_identity[Derived Identity].

NOTE: *When you have an inheritance hierarchy, you should specify the identity type in the _base instantiable_ class for the inheritance tree. This is then used for all persistent 
classes in the tree.* This means that you can have `@MappedSuperclass` without any identity fields/properties as superclass, and then the base instantiable class is the first persistable
class which has the identity field(s).

NOTE: Your "identity" will be used for any joins to related objects, so consider carefully what field(s) you want to use in this respect.


[[application_identity]]
== Application Identity

NOTE: Applicable to all datastores.

With *application identity* you are taking control of the specification of identity and define which field(s) in your class will define that identity. 
With *application identity* the field(s) of the primary key will be present as field(s) of the class itself. 
To specify that a class is to use *application identity*, you add the following to the MetaData for the class.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="mydomain.MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <id name="myPrimaryKeyField"/>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or, if we are using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    private long myPrimaryKeyField;
}
-----

*Application identity* requires a primary key class when you have multiple identity fields. Each persistable class may define a different class for its primary 
key, and different persistable classes can use the same primary key class, as appropriate. 
To provide an example, when we have *multiple identity fields* we also require an *id-class*, so using XML

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="mydomain.MyClass">
    <id-class class="mydomain.MyIdClass"/>
    <attributes>
        <id name="myPrimaryKeyField1"/>
        <id name="myPrimaryKeyField2"/>
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or, if we are using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@IdClass(class=MyIdClass.class)
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    private long myPrimaryKeyField1;
    
    @Id
    private long myPrimaryKeyField2;

}
-----

The definition of the `@IdClass` is described further below.

* link:metadata_xml.html#id[MetaData reference for <id> element]
* link:annotations.html#Id[Annotations reference for @Id]


=== Application Identity : Generating identities

For any field that is part of the "identity" you are responsible for defining how its value is set. 
Such field(s) can be set by the user, or can be generated.
JPA defines link:#value_generation[many ways of generating these identities] and DataNucleus supports all of these and provides some more of its own besides.


=== Application Identity : Changing Identities

JPA doesn't define what happens if you change the identity (an identity field) of an object once persistent. *DataNucleus doesn't support changes to identities.*


=== Application Identity : Accessing objects by Identity

You access an object from its object class name and identity "value" as follows

[source,java]
-----
MyClass myObj = em.find(MyClass.class, mykey);
-----

If your class has a single identity field and no "IdClass" then the _mykey_ is simply the value of that field.
If you have defined your own "IdClass" then the _mykey_ is the toString() form of the identity of your PK class.


[[application_identity_primarykey]]
=== Primary Key

When you choose application identity you are defining which fields of the class are part of the primary key,
and you are taking control of the specification of id's to DataNucleus. Application identity requires a primary key (PK) class, 
and each persistent capable class may define a different class for its primary key, and different persistent capable classes can 
use the same primary key class, as appropriate. 
If you have only a single primary-key field then there are built-in PK classes so you can forget this section. 


NOTE: If you are thinking of using multiple primary key fields in a class we would urge you to consider using a single (maybe surrogate) primary key field instead for
reasons of simplicity and performance. This also means that you can avoid the need to define your own primary key class.


Where you have more than 1 primary key field, you would define the PK class like this

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="MyClass">
    <id-class class="MyIdClass"/>
    ...
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@IdClass(class=MyIdClass.class)
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

You now need to define the PK class to use. This is simplified for you because *if you have only one PK field then you dont need to define a PK class* 
and you only define it when you have a composite PK.

An important thing to note is that the PK can only be made up of fields of the following Java types

* Primitives : *boolean*, *byte*, *char*, *int*, *long*, *short*
* java.lang : *Boolean*, *Byte*, *Character*, *Integer*, *Long*, *Short*, *String*, *Enum*, StringBuffer
* java.math : *BigInteger*
* java.sql : *Date*, *Time*, *Timestamp*
* java.util : *Date*, Currency, Locale, TimeZone, UUID
* java.net : URI, URL
* _persistable_

Note that the types in *bold* are JPA standard types. Any others are DataNucleus extensions and, as always, link:../datastores/datastores.html[check the specific datastore docs] 
to see what is supported for your datastore.

*Single PrimaryKey field*

The simplest way of using *application identity* is where you have a single PK field, and in this case you use an inbuilt primary key class that DataNucleus provides, 
so you don't need to specify the _id-class_. Let's take an example

[source,java]
-----
public class MyClass
{
    long id;
    ...
}
-----

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="MyClass">
    <attributes>
        <id name="id"/>
        ...
    </attributes>
</entity>
-----

or using annotations

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    long id;
    ...
}
-----

Note that we didn't specify the JPA "id-class". You will, of course, have to give the field a value before persisting the object, either by setting it yourself, or by using a 
link:#value_generation[value-strategy] on that field.


=== PrimaryKey : Rules for User-Defined classes

If you wish to use *application identity* and don't want to use the "SingleFieldIdentity" built-in PK classes then you must define a Primary Key class of your own. 
You can't use classes like java.lang.String, or java.lang.Long directly. You must follow these rules when defining your primary key class.

* The Primary Key class must be public
* The Primary Key class must implement Serializable
* The Primary Key class must have a public no-arg constructor, which might be the default constructor
* The PrimaryKey class can have a constructor taking the primary key fields, or can use Java bean setters/getters
* The field types of all non-static fields in the Primary Key class must be serializable, and are recommended to be primitive, String, Date, or Number types
* All serializable non-static fields in the Primary Key class can be public, but package/protected/private should also be fine
* The names of the non-static fields in the Primary Key class must include the names of the primary key fields in the Entity, and the types of the common fields must be identical
* The equals() and hashCode() methods of the Primary Key class must use the value(s) of all the fields corresponding to the primary key fields in the JPA entity
* If the Primary Key class is an inner class, it must be static
* The Primary Key class must override the toString() method defined in Object, and return a String that can be used as the parameter of a constructor
* The Primary Key class must provide a String constructor that returns an instance that compares equal to an instance that returned that String by the toString() method.
* The Primary Key class must be only used within a single inheritance tree.

Please note that if one of the fields that comprises the primary key is in itself an entity then you have xref:mapping.html#derived[Derived Identity]
and should consult the documentation for that feature which contains its own example.


image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Since there are many possible combinations of primary-key fields it is impossible for DataNucleus to provide a series of builtin composite primary key classes. 
However the link:enhancer.html[DataNucleus Enhancer] provides a mechanism for auto-generating a primary-key class for a persistable class. It follows the rules listed 
above and should work for all cases. Obviously if you want to tailor the output of things like the PK toString() method then you ought to define your own. 
The enhancer generation of primary-key class is only enabled if you don't define your own class.


NOTE: Your "id" class can store the target class name of the persistable object that it represents. This is useful where you want to avoid lookups of a class in an inheritance tree.
To do this, add a field to your id-class called _targetClassName_ and make sure that it is part of the _toString()_ and _String constructor_ code.


=== PrimaryKey Example - Multiple Field


NOTE: Again, if you are thinking of using multiple primary key fields in a class we would urge you to consider using a single (maybe surrogate) primary key field instead for
reasons of simplicity and performance. This also means that you can avoid the need to define your own primary key class.


Here's an example of a composite (multiple field) primary key class

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@IdClass(ComposedIdKey.class)
public class MyClass
{
    @Id
    String field1;

    @Id
    String field2;
    ...
}

public class ComposedIdKey implements Serializable
{
    public String targetClassName; // DataNucleus extension, storing the class name of the persistable object
    public String field1;
    public String field2;

    /**
     *  Default constructor.
     */
    public ComposedIdKey ()
    {
    }

    /**
     * Constructor accepting same input as generated by toString().
     */
    public ComposedIdKey(String value) 
    {
        StringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer (value, "::");
        this.targetClassName = token.nextToken();
        this.field1 = token.nextToken ();
        this.field2 = token.nextToken ();
    }

    public boolean equals(Object obj)
    {
        if (obj == this)
        {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(obj instanceof ComposedIdKey))
        {
            return false;
        }
        ComposedIdKey c = (ComposedIdKey)obj;

        return field1.equals(c.field1) && field2.equals(c.field2);
    }

    public int hashCode ()
    {
        return this.field1.hashCode() ^ this.field2.hashCode();
    }

    public String toString ()
    {
        // Give output expected by String constructor
        return this.targetClassName + this.field1 + "::" + this.field2;
    }
}

[[datastore_identity]]
== Datastore Identity

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, ODF, Excel, OOXML, XML, HBase, Cassandra, Neo4j, MongoDB, JSON

While JPA defines support for xref:mapping.html#application[application identity] only, DataNucleus also provides support for *datastore identity*. 
With *datastore identity* you are leaving the assignment of id's to DataNucleus and your class will *not* have a field for this identity - it will be added to the 
datastore representation by DataNucleus. It is, to all extents and purposes, a _surrogate key_ that will have its own column in the datastore. 
To specify that a class is to use *datastore identity* with JPA, you define the metadata as follows

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="mydomain.MyClass">
    <datastore-id/>
    ...
</entity>
-----

or using annotations, for example
[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@org.datanucleus.api.jpa.annotations.DatastoreIdentity
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

_Please note that since the JPA XML metadata is poorly designed it is not possible to specify datastore identity using XML, you have to use the annotations._


=== Datastore Identity : Generating identities

By choosing *datastore identity* you are handing the process of identity generation to the DataNucleus. 
This does not mean that you haven't got any control over how it does this. JPA defines many ways of generating these identities and 
DataNucleus supports all of these and provides some more of its own besides.

Defining which one to use is a simple matter of adding a MetaData element to your classes definition, like this

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@org.datanucleus.api.jpa.annotations.DatastoreIdentity(generationType=GenerationType.TABLE)
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

See also:-

* link:#value_generation[Identity Generation Guide] - strategies for generating ids
* link:annotations.html#DatastoreIdentity[Annotations reference for @DatastoreIdentity]


=== Datastore Identity : Accessing the Identity

When using *datastore identity*, the class has no associated field so you can't just access a field of the class to see its identity - if you need a field 
to be able to access the identity then you should be using xref:mapping.html#application_identity[application identity]. 
There are, however, ways to get the identity for the datastore identity case, if you have the object.

[source,java]
-----
import org.datanucleus.api.jpa.NucleusJPAHelper;

Object idKey = NucleusJPAHelper.getDatastoreIdForEntity(obj);
-----

From this you can use the "find" method to retrieve the object

[source,java]
-----
MyClass myObj = em.find(MyClass.class, idKey);
-----



[[nondurable_identity]]
== Nondurable Identity

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, ODF, Excel, OOXML, HBase, Neo4j, MongoDB

JPA requires that all objects have an identity. DataNucleus provides a vendor extension that allows objects of a class to not have a unique identity in the datastore. 
This type of identity is typically for log files, history files etc where you aren't going to access the object by key, but instead by a different parameter. 
In the datastore the table will typically not have a primary key. 
To specify that a class is to use *nondurable identity* with DataNucleus you would add the following to the MetaData for the class.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity class="mydomain.MyClass">
    <nondurable-id/>
    ...
</entity>
-----

or using annotations, for example

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
@org.datanucleus.api.jpa.annotations.NonDurableId
public class MyClass
{
    ...
}
-----

What this means for something like RDBMS is that the table of the class will not have a primary-key.


[[derived_identity]]
== Derived Identity Relationships

An derived identity relationship is a relationship between two objects of two classes in which the child object must coexist with the 
parent object and where the primary key of the child includes the Entity object of the parent. So effectively the key aspect of this
type of relationship is that the primary key of one of the classes includes a Entity field (hence why is is referred to as _Derived Identity_).
This type of relation is available in the following forms

* xref:mapping.html#derived_identity_1_1_uni[1-1 unidirectional]
* xref:mapping.html#derived_identity_1_N_coll_bi[1-N collection bidirectional using ForeignKey]
* xref:mapping.html#derived_identity_1_N_map_bi[1-N map bidirectional using ForeignKey (key stored in value)]

IMPORTANT: A more efficient relationship is to handle this as a standard 1-1/1-N relation, with individual id field in the related class, and then
define a unique constraint on the related class. This then foregoes the "derived identity" relationship idea and you can stick to standard relationships.

WARNING: In standard JPA, if the entity that is part of the id of the derived entity has a single long field then you can put a _long_
field in the identity class of the derived entity. In DataNucleus you *cannot* do this currently, and should define the `@IdClass` of the 
entity being contained and use that type in the identity class of the derived entity.

NOTE: The persistable class that is contained cannot be using _datastore identity_, and must be using _application identity_ with an objectid-class

TIP: When using derived identity, it is best practice to define an `@IdClass` for any entity that is part of the primary key, and *not* rely
on the built-in identity types.



[[derived_identity_1_1_uni]]
=== Derived 1-1 Relationship

Lets take the same classes as we have in the link:#one_one_relations[1-1 Relationships].
In the 1-1 relationships guide we note that in the datastore representation of the *User* and *Account* the `ACCOUNT` table has a primary key as well as a foreign-key to `USER`. 
In our example here we want to just have a primary key that is also a foreign-key to `USER`. 
To do this we need to modify the classes slightly and add primary-key fields and use "application-identity".

[source,java]
-----
public class User
{
    long id;

    ...
}

public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}
-----

In addition we need to define primary key classes for our *User* and *Account* classes

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class User
{
    @Id
    long id;

    ... (remainder of User class)

    /**
     * Inner class representing Primary Key
     */
    public static class PK implements Serializable
    {
        public long id;

        public PK()
        {
        }

        public PK(String s)
        {
            this.id = Long.valueOf(s).longValue();
        }

        public String toString()
        {
            return "" + id;
        }

        public int hashCode()
        {
            return (int)id;
        }

        public boolean equals(Object other)
        {
            if (other != null && (other instanceof PK))
            {
                PK otherPK = (PK)other;
                return otherPK.id == this.id;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
}

@Entity
public class Account
{
    @Id
    @OneToOne
    User user;

    ... (remainder of Account class)

    /**
     * Inner class representing Primary Key
     */
    public static class PK implements Serializable
    {
        public User.PK user; // Use same name as the real field above

        public PK()
        {
        }

        public PK(String s)
        {
            StringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer(s,"::");

            this.user = new User.PK(token.nextToken());
        }

        public String toString()
        {
            return "" + this.user.toString();
        }

        public int hashCode()
        {
            return user.hashCode();
        }

        public boolean equals(Object other)
        {
            if (other != null && (other instanceof PK))
            {
                PK otherPK = (PK)other;
                return this.user.equals(otherPK.user);
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
}
-----

To achieve what we want with the datastore schema we define the MetaData like this

[source,xml]
-----
<entity-mappings>
    <entity class="mydomain.User">
        <table name="USER"/>
        <id-class class="mydomain.User.PK"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="USER_ID"/>
            </id>
            <basic name="login">
                <column name="LOGIN" length="20"/>
            </basic>
        </attributes>
    </entity>

    <entity class="mydomain.Account">
        <table name="ACCOUNT"/>
        <id-class class="mydomain.Account.PK"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="user">
                <column name="USER_ID"/>
            </id>
            <basic name="firstName">
                <column name="FIRSTNAME" length="50"/>
            </basic>
            <basic name="secondName">
                <column name="LASTNAME" length="50"/>
            </basic>
            <one-to-one name="user"/>
        </attributes>
    </entity>
</entity-mappings>
-----

So now we have the following datastore schema

image:../images/relationship_1_1_compound_db.png[]

Things to note:-

* In the child Primary Key class, you must have a field with the same name as the relationship in the child class, and the field in the child Primary Key class must 
be the same type as the Primary Key class of the parent
* See also the xref:mapping.html#application_identity_primarykey[general instructions for Primary Key classes]
* You can only have one "Account" object linked to a particular "User" object since the FK to the "User" is now the primary key of "Account". 
To remove this restriction you could also add a "long id" to  "Account" and make the "Account.PK" a composite primary-key

[[derived_identity_1_N_coll_bi]]
=== Derived 1-N Collection Relationship

Lets take the same classes as we have in the link:#one_many_fk_bi[1-N Relationships (FK)].
In the 1-N relationships guide we note that in the datastore representation of the *Account* and *Address* classes the `ADDRESS` table has a primary key as 
well as a foreign-key to `ACCOUNT`. In our example here we want to have the primary-key to `ACCOUNT` to _include_ the foreign-key. 
To do this we need to modify the classes slightly, adding primary-key fields to both classes, and use "application-identity" for both.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    long id;

    Set<Address> addresses;

    ...
}

public class Address
{
    long id;

    Account account;

    ...
}
-----

In addition we need to define primary key classes for our *Account* and *Address* classes

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    @Id
    long id;

    @OneToMany
    Set<Address> addresses = new HashSet<>();

    ... (remainder of Account class)

    /**
     * Inner class representing Primary Key
     */
    public static class PK implements Serializable
    {
        public long id;

        public PK()
        {
        }

        public PK(String s)
        {
            this.id = Long.valueOf(s).longValue();
        }

        public String toString()
        {
            return "" + id;
        }

        public int hashCode()
        {
            return (int)id;
        }

        public boolean equals(Object other)
        {
            if (other != null && (other instanceof PK))
            {
                PK otherPK = (PK)other;
                return otherPK.id == this.id;
            }
            return false;

To achieve what we want with the datastore schema we define the MetaData like this

[source,xml]
-----
<entity-mappings>
    <entity class="mydomain.Account">
        <table name="ACCOUNT"/>
        <id-class class="mydomain.Account.PK"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="ACCOUNT_ID"/>
            </id>
            <basic name="firstName">
                <column name="FIRSTNAME" length="50"/>
            </basic>
            <basic name="secondName">
                <column name="LASTNAME" length="50"/>
            </basic>
            <one-to-many name="addresses" mapped-by="account"/>

So now we have the following datastore schema

image:../images/relationship_1_N_compound_db.png[]

Things to note :-

* In the child Primary Key class, you must have a field with the same name as the relationship in the child class, and the field in the child Primary Key class 
must be the same type as the Primary Key class of the parent
* See also the xref:mapping.html#application_identity_primarykey[general instructions for Primary Key classes]
* If we had omitted the "id" field from "Address" it would have only been possible to have one "Address" in the "Account" "addresses" collection due to PK constraints. 
For that reason we have the "id" field too.


[[derived_identity_1_N_map_bi]]
=== Derived 1-N Map Relationship

Lets take the same classes as we have in the link:#one_many_map_fk_bi_key[1-N Relationships FK].
In this guide we note that in the datastore representation of the *Account* and *Address* classes the `ADDRESS` table has a primary key as well as a foreign-key to `ACCOUNT`. 
In our example here we want to have the primary-key to `ACCOUNT` to _include_ the foreign-key. 
To do this we need to modify the classes slightly, adding primary-key fields to both classes, and use "application-identity" for both.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    long id;

    Map<String, Address> addresses;

    ...
}

public class Address
{
    long id;

    String alias;

    Account account;

    ...
}
-----

In addition we need to define primary key classes for our *Account* and *Address* classes

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    @Id
    long id;

    @OneToMany
    Map<String, Address> addresses;

    ... (remainder of Account class)

    /**
     * Inner class representing Primary Key
     */
    public static class PK implements Serializable
    {
        public long id;

        public PK()
        {
        }

        public PK(String s)
        {
            this.id = Long.valueOf(s).longValue();
        }

        public String toString()
        {
            return "" + id;
        }

        public int hashCode()
        {
            return (int)id;
        }

        public boolean equals(Object other)
        {
            if (other != null && (other instanceof PK))
            {
                PK otherPK = (PK)other;
                return otherPK.id == this.id;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
}

@Entity
public class Address
{
    @Id
    String alias;

    @Id
    @ManyToOne
    Account account;

    .. (remainder of Address class)

    /**
     * Inner class representing Primary Key
     */
    public static class PK implements Serializable
    {
        public String alias; // Same name as real field above
        public Account.PK account; // Same name as the real field above

        public PK()
        {
        }

        public PK(String s)
        {
            StringTokenizer token = new StringTokenizer(s,"::");
            this.alias = Long.valueOf(token.nextToken()).longValue();
            this.account = new Account.PK(token.nextToken());
        }

        public String toString()
        {
            return alias + "::" + this.account.toString();
        }

        public int hashCode()
        {
            return alias.hashCode() ^ account.hashCode();
        }

        public boolean equals(Object other)
        {
            if (other != null && (other instanceof PK))
            {
                PK otherPK = (PK)other;
                return otherPK.alias.equals(this.alias) && this.account.equals(otherPK.account);
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
}
