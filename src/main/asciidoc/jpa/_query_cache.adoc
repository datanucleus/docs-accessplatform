JPA doesn't currently define a mechanism for caching of queries. DataNucleus provides 3 levels of caching

* link:#cache_genericcompilation[Generic Compilation] : when a query is compiled it is initially compiled _generically_ into expression trees. 
This generic compilation is independent of the datastore in use, so can be used for other datastores. This can be cached.
* link:#cache_datastorecompilation[Datastore Compilation] : after a query is compiled into expression trees (above) it is then converted into the native language of the datastore in use. 
For example with RDBMS, it is converted into SQL. This can be cached
* link:#cache_results[Results] : when a query is run and returns objects of the candidate type, you can cache the identities of the result objects.


[[cache_genericcompilation]]
== Generic Query Compilation Cache

This cache is by default set to _soft_, meaning that the generic query compilation is cached using soft references. 
This is set using the persistence property *datanucleus.cache.queryCompilation.type*. 
You can also set it to _strong_ meaning that strong references are used, or _weak_ meaning that weak references are used.

You can turn caching on/off (default = on) on a query-by-query basis by specifying the query extension *datanucleus.query.compilation.cached* as true/false.


[[cache_datastorecompilation]]
== Datastore Query Compilation Cache

This cache is by default set to _soft_, meaning that the datastore query compilation is cached using soft references. 
This is set using the persistence property *datanucleus.cache.queryCompilationDatastore.type*. 
You can also set it to _strong_ meaning that strong references are used, or _weak_ meaning that weak references are used.

You can turn caching on/off (default = on) on a query-by-query basis by specifying the query extension *datanucleus.query.compilation.cached* as true/false.
As a finer degree of control, where cached results are used, you can omit the validation of object existence in the datastore by setting the query extension
*datanucleus.query.resultCache.validateObjects*.


[[cache_results]]
== Query Results Cache

This cache is by default set to _soft_, meaning that the datastore query results are cached using soft references. 
This is set using the persistence property *datanucleus.cache.queryResults.type*. 
You can also set it to _strong_ meaning that strong references are used, or _weak_ meaning that weak references are used.

You can specify persistence property *datanucleus.cache.queryResults.cacheName* to define the name of the cache used for the query results cache.

You can specify persistence property *datanucleus.cache.queryResults.expireMillis* to specify the expiry of caching of results, for caches that support it.

You can specify persistence property *datanucleus.cache.queryResults.maxSize* to define the maximum number of queries that have their results cached, for caches that support it.

You can turn caching on/off (default = off) on a query-by-query basis by specifying the query extension *datanucleus.query.results.cached* as true/false.

Obviously with a cache of query results, you don't necessarily want to retain this cached over a long period. In this situation you can evict results from the cache like this.

which evicts the results of the specific query. 
The JPAQueryCache image:../images/javadoc.png[Javadoc, link=http://www.datanucleus.org/javadocs/api.jpa/latest/org/datanucleus/api/jpa/JPAQueryCache.html] 
has more options available should you need them.
