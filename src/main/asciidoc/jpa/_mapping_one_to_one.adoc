[[one_one_relations]]
= 1-1 Relations
:_basedir: ../
:_imagesdir: images/

You have a 1-to-1 relationship when an object of a class has an associated object of another class (only 
one associated object). It could also be between an object of a class and another object of the same class 
(obviously). You can create the relationship in 2 ways depending on whether the 2 classes know about each 
other (bidirectional), or whether only one of the classes knows about the other class (unidirectional). 
These are described below.

NOTE: For RDBMS a 1-1 relation is stored as a foreign-key column(s), or less likely as an entry in a join table. 
For non-RDBMS it is stored as a String "column" storing the 'id' (possibly with the class-name included in the string) of the related object.

NOTE: You cannot have a 1-1 relation to a long/int field! JPA is for use with object-oriented systems, not flat data.


[[one_one_uni]]
== Unidirectional (ForeignKey)

For this case you could have 2 classes, *User* and *Account*, as below.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

so the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, but not vice-versa. If you define the annotations for these classes as follows

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    ...

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="USER_ID")
    User user;
}

@Entity
public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity-mappings>
    <entity class="User">
        <table name="USER"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="USER_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
    </entity>

    <entity class="Account">
        <table name="ACCOUNT"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="ACCOUNT_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
            <one-to-one name="user">
                <join-column name="USER_ID"/>
            </one-to-one>
        </attributes>
    </entity>
</entity-mappings>
-----


This will create 2 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), and `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*, with a column `USER_ID`), as shown below.

image:../images/relationship_1_1_uni_db.png[]


NOTE: *Account* has the object reference to *User* (and so is the "owner" of the relation) and so its table holds the foreign-key

NOTE: If you call _EntityManager.remove()_ on the end of a 1-1 unidirectional relation without the relation and that object is related to another object, 
an exception will typically be thrown (assuming the datastore supports foreign keys). To delete this record you should remove the other objects association first.


[[one_one_uni_join]]
== Unidirectional (JoinTable)

NOTE: Supported for RDBMS. Other datastores simply ignore the join table and store the relation in a column in the table of the object with the field.

For this case we have the same 2 classes, *User* and *Account*, as before.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}

public class User
{
    ...
}
-----

so the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, but not vice-versa, and are using a join table. 
A particular user could be related to several accounts. If you define the annotations for these classes as follows

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    @OneToOne
    @JoinTable(name="ACCOUNT_USER")
    User user;

    ....
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity-mappings>
    <entity class="User">
        <table name="USER"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="USER_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
        </attributes>
    </entity>

    <entity class="Account">
        <table name="ACCOUNT"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="ACCOUNT_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
            <one-to-one name="user">
                <join-table name="ACCOUNT_USER"/>
            </one-to-one>
        </attributes>
    </entity>
</entity-mappings>
-----

This will create 3 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*), and a join table `ACCOUNT_USER`, as shown below.

image:../images/relationship_N_1_uni_db.png[]

NOTE: in the case of non-RDBMS datastores there is no join-table, simply a "column" in the `ACCOUNT` "table", storing the "id" of the related object




[[one_one_bi]]
== Bidirectional (ForeignKey)

For this case you could have 2 classes, *User* and *Account* again, but this time as below. Here the *Account* class knows about the *User* class, and also vice-versa.

[source,java]
-----
public class Account
{
    User user;

    ...
}

public class User
{
    Account account;

    ...
}
-----


We create the 1-1 relationship with a single foreign-key. To do this you define the annotations as

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Account
{
    ...

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="USER_ID")
    User user;
}

@Entity
public class User
{
    ...

    @OneToOne(mappedBy="user")
    Account account;

    ...
}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity-mappings>
    <entity class="User">
        <table name="USER"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="USER_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
            <one-to-one name="account" mapped-by="user"/>
        </attributes>
    </entity>

    <entity class="Account">
        <table name="ACCOUNT"/>
        <attributes>
            <id name="id">
                <column name="ACCOUNT_ID"/>
            </id>
            ...
            <one-to-one name="user">
                <join-column name="USER_ID"/>
            </one-to-one>
        </attributes>
    </entity>
</entity-mappings>
-----

The difference is that we added _mapped-by_ to the field of *User* making it bidirectional (and putting the FK at the other side for RDBMS)

This will create 2 tables in the database, `USER` (for class *User*), and `ACCOUNT` (for class *Account*). For RDBMS it includes a `USER_ID`
column in the `ACCOUNT` table, like this

image:../images/relationship_1_1_bi_db_singlefk.png[]

For other types of datastore it will have a _USER_ID_ column in the `ACCOUNT` table and a `ACCOUNT` column in the `USER` table.

NOTE: When forming the relation please make sure that *you set the relation at BOTH sides* since DataNucleus would have no way of knowing which end is correct if you only set one end.


[[one_one_bi_join]]
== Bidirectional (JoinTable)

NOTE: DataNucleus does not support a 1-1 BIDIRECTIONAL relation using a join table. It is not a use-case that is very common and is not part of the JPA spec. 
You could look at doing that as a unidirectional relation.
