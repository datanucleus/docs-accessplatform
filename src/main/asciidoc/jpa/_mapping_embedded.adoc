The JPA persistence strategy typically involves persisting the fields of any class into its own table, and representing any relationships from the fields 
of that class across to other tables. 
There are occasions when this is undesirable, maybe due to an existing datastore schema, because a more convenient datastore model is required, or maybe
you simply don't want an instance of some type to have its own _identity_ and so that type will only co-exist with an owner object.
JPA allows the persistence of fields as _embedded_ typically into the same table as the "owning" class. 
To define a class to be _embedded_ into other objects you make use of the `@Embeddable` annotation (instead of `@Entity`) in this case.

[source,java]
-----
@Embeddable
public class MyClass {}
-----

or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<embeddable name="mydomain.MyClass">
    ...
</embeddable>
-----

With the above MetaData (using the _embeddable_ definition), in our application any objects of the class *MyClass* can be embedded into other objects.

JPA's definition of embedding encompasses several types of fields. These are described below

* link:#embedded_entity[Embedded Entities] - where you have a 1-1 relationship and you want to embed the other Entity into the same table as the your object
* link:#embedded_entity_nested[Embedded Nested Entities] - like the first example except that the other object also has another Entity that also should be embedded
* link:#embedded_collection[Embedded Collection elements] - where you want to embed the elements of a collection into a join table (instead of persisting them into their own table)
* link:#embedded_map[Embedded Map keys/values] - where you want to embed the keys/values of a map into a join table (instead of persisting them into their own table)


[[embedded_entity_structure]]
== Embedded entity structure

With respect to what types of fields you can have in an embedded class, DataNucleus supports all basic types, as well as 1-1/N-1 relations
(where the _foreign-key_ is at the embedded object side), and some 1-N/M-N relations.

NOTE: Whilst nested embedded members are supported, you *cannot use recursive embedded objects* since that would require potentially infinite columns in the owner table, 
or infinite embedded join tables.


NOTE: You can have inheritance in an embedded entity but only using _SINGLE_TABLE_ strategy using a discriminator (you must define it in the metadata of the embedded type). 
Note that this is a DataNucleus extension since JPA doesn't define any support for embedded inherited entities.

In a typical 1-1 relationship between 2 classes, the 2 classes in the relationship are persisted to their own table, and a foreign key is managed between them. With JPA and 
DataNucleus you can persist the related entity object as embedded into the same table. This results in a single table in the datastore rather than one for each of the 2 classes.

Let's take an example. We are modelling a *Computer*, and in our simple model our *Computer* has a graphics card and a sound card. 
So we model these cards using a *ComputerCard* class. So our classes become

[source,java]
-----
public class Computer
{
    private String operatingSystem;

    private ComputerCard graphicsCard;

    private ComputerCard soundCard;

    public Computer(String osName, ComputerCard graphics, ComputerCard sound)
    {
        this.operatingSystem = osName;
        this.graphicsCard = graphics;
        this.soundCard = sound;
    }

    ...
}

public class ComputerCard
{
    public static final int ISA_CARD = 0;
    public static final int PCI_CARD = 1;
    public static final int AGP_CARD = 2;

    private String manufacturer;

    private int type;

    public ComputerCard(String manufacturer, int type)
    {
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        this.type = type;
    }

    ...
}
-----

The traditional (default) way of persisting these classes would be to have a table to represent each class. So our datastore will look like this

image:../images/embedded_pc_traditional_db.png[]

However we decide that we want to persist *Computer* objects into a table called `COMPUTER` and we also want to persist the PC cards into the _same table_. 
We define our MetaData like this

[source,java]
-----
public class Computer
{
    @Embedded
    @AttributeOverride(name="manufacturer", column=@Column(name="GRAPHICS_MANUFACTURER"))
    @AttributeOverride(name="type", column=@Column(name="GRAPHICS_TYPE"))
    private ComputerCard graphicsCard;

    @Embedded
    @AttributeOverride(name="manufacturer", column=@Column(name="SOUND_MANUFACTURER"))
    @AttributeOverride(name="type", column=@Column(name="SOUND_TYPE"))
    private ComputerCard soundCard;

    ...
}

@Embeddable
public class ComputerCard
{
    ...
}
-----

Or using XML metadata

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.Computer">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="operatingSystem">
            <column="OS_NAME"/>
        </basic>
        <embedded name="graphicsCard">
            <attribute-override name="manufacturer">
                <column="GRAPHICS_MANUFACTURER"/>
            </attribute-override>
            <attribute-override name="type">
                <column="GRAPHICS_TYPE"/>
            </attribute-override>
        </embedded>
        <embedded name="soundCard">
            <attribute-override name="manufacturer">
                <column="SOUND_MANUFACTURER"/>
            </attribute-override>
            <attribute-override name="type">
                <column="SOUND_TYPE"/>
            </attribute-override>
        </embedded>
    </attributes>
</entity>
<embeddable name="mydomain.ComputerCard">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="manufacturer"/>
        <basic name="type"/>
    </attributes>
</embeddable>
-----

So here we will end up with a table called `COMPUTER` with columns `COMPUTER_ID`, `OS_NAME`, `GRAPHICS_MANUFACTURER`, `GRAPHICS_TYPE`, `SOUND_MANUFACTURER`, `SOUND_TYPE`. 
If we call persist() on any objects of type *Computer*, they will be persisted into this table.

=== Null embedded objects

image:../images/nucleus_extension.png[]

DataNucleus supports persistence of null embedded objects using the following metadata

[source,java]
-----
@Extension(key="null-indicator-column", value"MY_COL")
@Extension(key="null-indicator-value", value="SomeValue")
-----

and these will be used when persisting and retrieving the embedded object.

[[embedded_entity_nested]]
== Embedding Nested Entities

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, Excel, OOXML, ODF, HBase, MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, JSON

In the above example we had an embeddable entity within an entity. What if our embeddable object also contain another embeddable entity? 
Using the above example, what if *ComputerCard* contains an object of type *Connector* ?

[source,java]
-----
@Embeddable
public class ComputerCard
{
    @Embedded
    Connector connector;

    public ComputerCard(String manufacturer, int type, Connector conn)
    {
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        this.type = type;
        this.connector = conn;
    }

    ...
}

@Embeddable
public class Connector
{
    int type;
}
-----

We want to store all of these objects into the same record in the `COMPUTER` table.

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.Computer">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="operatingSystem">
            <column="OS_NAME"/>
        </basic>
        <embedded name="graphicsCard">
            <attribute-override name="manufacturer">
                <column="GRAPHICS_MANUFACTURER"/>
            </attribute-override>
            <attribute-override name="type">
                <column="GRAPHICS_TYPE"/>
            </attribute-override>
            <attribute-override name="connector.type">
                <column="GRAPHICS_CONNECTOR_TYPE"/>
            </attribute-override>
        </embedded>
        <embedded name="soundCard">
            <attribute-override name="manufacturer">
                <column="SOUND_MANUFACTURER"/>
            </attribute-override>
            <attribute-override name="type">
                <column="SOUND_TYPE"/>
            </attribute-override>
            <attribute-override name="connector.type">
                <column="SOUND_CONNECTOR_TYPE"/>
            </attribute-override>
        </embedded>
    </attributes>
</entity>
<embeddable name="mydomain.ComputerCard">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="manufacturer"/>
        <basic name="type"/>
    </attributes>
</embeddable>
<embeddable name="mydomain.Connector">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="type"/>
    </attributes>
</embeddable>
-----

So we simply nest the embedded definition of the *Connector* objects within the embedded definition of the *ComputerCard* definitions for *Computer*. 
JPA supports this to as many levels as you require! The *Connector* objects will be persisted into the `GRAPHICS_CONNECTOR_TYPE`, and `SOUND_CONNECTOR_TYPE` columns in the `COMPUTER` table.

[[embedded_collection]]
== Embedding Collection Elements

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, MongoDB

In a typical 1-N relationship between 2 classes, the 2 classes in the relationship are persisted to their own table, and either a join table or a 
foreign key is used to relate them. With JPA and DataNucleus you have a variation on the join table relation where you can persist the objects of 
the "N" side into the join table itself so that they don't have their own identity, and aren't stored in the table for that class.
*This is supported in DataNucleus with the following provisos*

* You can have inheritance in embedded keys/values using _SINGLE_TABLE_ strategy with a discriminator (you must define the discriminator in the metadata of the embedded type).
* When retrieving embedded elements, all fields are retrieved in one call. That is, fetch plans are not utilised. This is because the embedded element has 
no identity so we have to retrieve all initially.

It should be noted that where the collection "element" is not an entity or of a "reference" type (Interface or Object) it will *always* be embedded, and 
this functionality here applies to embeddable entity elements only. DataNucleus doesn't support the embedding of "reference type" objects currently.

Let's take an example. We are modelling a *Network*, and in our simple model our *Network* has collection of *Device(s)*. 
We decide that instead of *Device* having its own table, we want to persist them into the join table of its relationship with the *Network* since they are only used by the network itself. 

So we define our classes, using annotations, as follows

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class Network
{
    private String name;

    @Embedded
    @ElementCollection
    @CollectionTable(name="NETWORK_DEVICES", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="NETWORK_ID"))
    private Collection<Device> devices = new HashSet<>();

    public Network(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }

    ...
}

@Embeddable
public class Device
{
    @Column(name="DEVICE_NAME")
    private String name;

    @Column(name="DEVICE_IP_ADDR")
    private String ipAddress;

    public Device(String name, String addr)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.ipAddress = addr;
    }

    ...
}
-----

Alternatively using XML MetaData

[source,xml]
-----
<entity name="mydomain.Network">
    <attributes>
        ...
        <element-collection name="devices">
            <collection-table name="NETWORK_DEVICES">
                <join-column name="NETWORK_ID"/>
            </collection-table>
        </element-collection>
    </attributes>
</entity>
<embeddable name="mydomain.Device">
    <attributes>
        <basic name="name">
            <column="DEVICE_NAME"/>
        </basic>
        <basic name="ipAddress">
            <column="DEVICE_IP_ADDR"/>
        </basic>
    </attributes>
</embeddable>
-----

So here we will end up with a table `NETWORK` with columns `NETWORK_ID`, and `NAME`, and a table `NETWORK_DEVICES` with columns 
`NETWORK_ID`, (optional `ADPT_PK_IDX`), `DEVICE_NAME`, `DEVICE_IP_ADDR`. When we persist a *Network* object, any devices are persisted into the `NETWORK_DEVICES` table.

image:../images/embedded_collection_embedded_db.png[]


NOTE: If you want to override the name of the fields of the embedded element in the collection table, you could use `@AttributeOverride` 
(when using annotations) or `<attribute-override>` (when using XML).

NOTE: By default a primary key constraint will be added to the table containing the embedded elements, formed from the id of the owner plus all columns representing fields of the element. 
You can turn this off using `@Extension(key="primary-key" value="false")`

[[embedded_map]]
== Embedding Map Keys/Values

NOTE: Applicable to RDBMS, MongoDB

In a typical 1-N map relationship between classes, the classes in the relationship are persisted to their own table, 
and a join table forms the map linkage. With JPA and DataNucleus you have a variation on the join table relation 
where you can persist either the key class or the value class, or both key class and value class into the join table.
*This is supported in DataNucleus with the following provisos*

* You can have inheritance in embedded keys/values using _SINGLE_TABLE_ strategy with a discriminator (you must define the discriminator in the metadata of the embedded type).
* When retrieving embedded keys/values, all fields are retrieved in one call. That is, entity graphs and fetch specifications are not utilised. 
This is because the embedded key/value has no identity so we have to retrieve all initially.


It should be noted that where the map "key"/"value" is not _persistable_ or of a "reference" type (Interface or Object) it will *always* be embedded, 
and this functionality here applies to _persistable_ keys/values only. 

NOTE: DataNucleus doesn't support embedding reference type elements currently.

Let's take an example. We are modelling a *FilmLibrary*, and in our simple model our *FilmLibrary* has map of *Film*s, keyed by a String alias. So we define our classes as

[source,java]
-----
@Entity
public class FilmLibrary
{
    private String owner;

    @Embedded
    @ElementCollection
    @CollectionTable(name="FILM_LIBRARY_FILMS")
    @MapKeyColumn(name="FILM_ALIAS")
    private Map<String, Film> films = new HashMap<>();

    public FilmLibrary(String owner)
    {
        this.owner = owner;
    }

    ...
}

public class Film
{
    @Column(name="FILM_NAME")
    private String name;

    @Column(name="FILM_DIRECTOR")
    private String director;

    public Film(String name, String director)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.director = director;
    }

    ...
}
-----

So here we will end up with a table `FILM_LIBRARY` with columns `FILM_LIBRARY_ID`, and `OWNER`, and a table `FILM_LIBRARY_FILMS` 
with columns `FILM_LIBRARY_ID`, `FILM_ALIAS`, `FILM_NAME`, `FILM_DIRECTOR`. When we persist a *FilmLibrary* object, any films are persisted into the `FILM_LIBRARY_FILMS` table.

image:../images/embedded_map_embedded_db.png[]

Note that if you want to override the name of the fields of the embedded key/value in the table of the owner, you should use `@AttributeOverride` (when using annotations) 
or `<attribute-override>` (when using XML). In the case of fields of an embedded key you should set the name as "key.{fieldName}" 
and in the case of fields of an embedded value you should set the name as "value.{fieldName}".
